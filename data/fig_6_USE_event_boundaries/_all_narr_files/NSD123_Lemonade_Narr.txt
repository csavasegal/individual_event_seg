Speaker 1:	Okay, Rube Goldberg machines are really—kind of there are a lot of these videos out there now. They're always—they're almost always very interesting. I thought a lot of the elements here were rather clever. The bouncing ball, golf ball off the floor first got me and the use of the laptop computer to show an image of what was going on behind it on the camera screen was rather clever and something I haven't seen before. Also the use of the cell phones, certainly think it could have been quite a bit shorter. The element with the camera didn't need to ring quite as many times as it did. So I did get bored watching a few moments of it but throughout the whole thing I kept thinking about how much time it would have taken to set that up. The failed runs, but not just that the having to kind of change your lifestyle, the way that you live in that apartment, in that space or the house or whatever it—well I guess it was a house. Living among all those contraptions and the toys and things set up. Having to work around it in the kitchen, having to work around it in the bathroom. And there's all that space outside probably could have done more in the exterior but then again outside you're exposed to the elements and less control over the environment and what goes on. So I suppose that's understandable. And I also kept wondering what was going to happen in the end? What was the point of all this? Lemonade I guess it's good. I don't know what else it could have been. You know I think these things it always reminds me of I think it was Pee Wee Herman when I was a kid and whatever he used to get ready for the day. All the stupid little devices that were used to make his breakfast and brush his teeth and that sort of thing.
