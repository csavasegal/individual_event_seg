Okay, so this film was about a family, a mother and her son and daughter. I believe the son was Tommy and the daughter's name was Tiny. The film starts off with Tommy he during one of their dinners he arrives to the kitchen first and he ends up taking some food from Tiny's plate and putting it on his own plate so that he could eat more. And Tiny noticed this, but she didn't do or say anything. The film then proceeds throughout it jumps forward in time and shows several events where Tommy he takes advantage of his little sister by taking her seat on the bus stop or tricking her in order to beat her at a race. And a lot of these things really kind of show the kind of selfish character of Tommy. As the film proceeds Tiny she's a child genius of some sort at the age of 12 or something she ended up building her own time machine all -- out which is very crazy. So she ended up building a time machine which then she uses and it seems to me like she goes back in time to redo all the events in which she was taken advantage of by her older brother. So in the last scene she uses the time machine to go back to a time where Tommy takes food from her plate, and she ends up taking food from his plate as the roles are reversed. In general the scene, this film was pretty interesting and captivating to watch. I generally enjoy films that kind of show a streamline of events well, like a timeline of events start to finish. And I'm still trying to figure out what the takeaway or the lesson of the film is and I guess it's to always treat others as with respect and as nicely as possible and to kind of not act as how Tommy did toward his sister.
