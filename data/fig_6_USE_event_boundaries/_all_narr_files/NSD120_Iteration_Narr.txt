Speaker 1:	So the film starts out with a girl and it's empty except for a bed and a nightstand and a lamp room, a very bright room. And she wakes up and after every 60 seconds she passes out and wakes up again. They call it like an iteration. So in this first room she figures out that she has to stand on this little dot in order for the door to unlock. She also figures out that her—the past iterations are saved with the actions she does in each iteration don't go away. They sort of build upon one another. So she figures out she stands on the dot and then she in the next iteration she opens the door into the next room which has a bunch of light pink balloons. The room's just filled with these light pink balloons and she finds a little grey pillow with a needle on it. And so she starts popping all the pink balloons and then the time runs out, so she has to come back into the room and the balloons she popped before are still popped. She just continues working to pop the balloons until eventually she figures out to use the needle to open the lock into the next room. So she goes into the next room and there's this huge tree and she also finds an axe. So she starts to use the axe to hack down the tree and this takes a lot of iterations she has. There's probably 10 different iterations working on the tree. And then the tree starts to form again like to heal itself. So she sort of gives up and then the next time she wakes up she sort of gives up and goes back to sleep. Then the next time she wakes up she goes back to the tree and then uses the axe to push a hole in one of the walls. So she presses a hole in one of the walls and then walks through and finds a guy doing the same thing, walking into the same room as her and they meet.
