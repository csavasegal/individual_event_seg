Speaker 1:	Okay, what I remember from the video. Strange, still working on it. So she made a time machine because his brother was being a jerk. And so not that scared of it the not being a jerk anymore. They're cute. I think maybe there were like Irish or English something along those lines. He was definitely being a jerk, especially to that child that had the disability. And she was just trying to be nice, poor girl. I'm glad my brother wasn't like that. Why was she named Tiny? That's a great question. Her mom was mean to name her that. She's smart. She had a problem and she figured it out I guess. Yeah, they were eating chicken fingers and fries for dinner something like that. Had a little ketchup squirt bottle that looks like a tomato. The penguin timer was cute.  I hope he learns his lesson and that he's going to be a nicer brother, just being mean. Yes, and the mom should definitely spend more time with her kids. She's in her room not really caring about what's going on. She could eat dinner with them, maybe set a good example et cetera. I don't really get why she snuck out in the middle of the night, I guess that was to make her time machine. I think I might have missed that bit a little bit. I hope she liked the friend and grows up and moves away and never has to deal with her mean brother again. Or maybe they will have a good relationship in the future. Yes, otherwise great film. I don't really get why they were racing. I was never in the same gym class as my brother but that's cool. Also, she took all his food in the end. Is that better? Is she just becoming more like him? These are the things I wonder.
