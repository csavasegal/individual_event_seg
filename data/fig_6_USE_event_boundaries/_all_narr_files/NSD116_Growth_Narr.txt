Speaker 1:	 So the video is eerie. It looked like it was a time course for one particular family. It started out with a couple as they navigated through the house. We saw the different events in place. The birth of the first child to interactions between two siblings when they were younger, to purchasing a new home and family dinners. At some point the plot took sort of a turn and I guess the setting kind of foreshadows it. Perhaps the events that were going to follow may not be the most satisfying or happy even. The older brother is going through a difficult time period and is the most that kind of seemed familiar. Just because I think most adolescents go through a period such as the one that was depicted. And when he came back it seemed like he was a bit happier. I think he came back with a partner. And things seemed to be okay, but he noticed that his brother may have some anger similar to what he had or may have been dealing with issues similar to what he had. So he took his brother with him against his parents wishes and I'm hoping that it helped him out. I thought the direction was good if the goal was to make you feel comfortable that was done well. The picture quality was great and that's especially good considering what they were aiming to do. To me it felt abstract, but I don't even know what the meaning of abstract is necessarily. I liked their new home.
