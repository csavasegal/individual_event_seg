All right, well what I just watched it was a short film that seemed like it's about a growth of a family. It started out with a dad and mom who moved in together in the house and as it progressed through life they had their first child, second child. Both are boys. And I thought it was really neat how they really blended every single scene together into one very long scene. I'm not really sure how they did that. But that's really cool how it all just blended together. So as the characters move through life the two boys grew up and got older. I assume the older son started—they had some family problems. I'm not really sure why but he eventually moved out and left the two parents. And shortly after the younger son followed the older brother. So that was—I'm still trying to figure out what exactly happened that caused them to want to leave the family but that's what they decided to end up doing. And in general I would say the film is pretty—had a kind of dark vibe and dark ending to it. It kind of started out as happy and then as the characters grew up and time moved forward they seemed to encounter more and more problems. And the family seemed more anxious and tense than ever. So there's definitely that whole mood to the short film. But, I don't know I'd say I enjoyed it. I liked how I definitely have a knack for good cinematography and acting and that was definitely a very enjoyable short film. I guess I kind of relate to the characters in a way. I definitely had my rebellious teenage phase at one point in my life. So I can kind of see myself a little bit in those characters especially the older guy, the older son I mean. And yeah, definitely a film that I enjoyed.
