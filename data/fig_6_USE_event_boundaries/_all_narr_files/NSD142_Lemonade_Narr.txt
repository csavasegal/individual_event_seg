Yes, so the first thing it came to mind is that the—this movie looked just like this Japanese channel called PythagoraSwitch in—it's actually a kid's channel. It's this is not as long as—this Japanese channel is not as long as this one but therefore maybe like a minute or so and it looked just like this. The only difference is that this Japanese channel play the music and but they're both very similar because they both use the stuff that is very similar that you see every day. This movie was much longer but I really enjoyed it because it was very familiar to me that they used the kid's toys, the kitchen equipment, the cups and the spatula and the balloons and it was very fun to watch. And that film took place was inside the house and also outside and it was very enjoyable to watch. So and this—during this movie I was thinking how long did it take to film? And how many people are involved? And maybe like in the middle of that movie it showed the maybe like five people's picture, so I was like okay, maybe this is the people that created this movie. And they were all young maybe like college students looking young people. And also I remember thinking when it showed the slime, and the slime was dropping very slowly and that irritated me a little bit because I wanted to see what was going to happen next quick. And also I remember seeing the balloon hitting the cactus, so I was worried that the balloon was going to pop. And but I was very enjoy—was very—I enjoyed watching the movie.
