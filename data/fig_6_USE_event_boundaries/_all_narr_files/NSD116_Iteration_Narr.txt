Speaker 1:	So the short film it looked like there was this woman who was in an experiment. The experiment looked like she was reliving certain moments over and over and had to pass from one stage to the next. She had to accomplish her tasks in a given period of time. The room was set to be white that may be kind of impersonal, kind of it's a little bit creepy almost just because you know the world is moving towards trying to incorporate more natural cues or environmental cues in the workplace and other environments. So but I guess that's a bit in considering what seemed to be like a regulated research environment. And then it seemed like things were finally on the up and up for this stage where she was to chop down the tree with the axe. And her and her clones are able to do so but to a certain extent before the tree started to regenerate. And she finally decided to use the axe to cut down a part of the wall instead of the tree and she met someone else there. I enjoyed the film. I'm glad that the NIH doesn't do something that intense or maybe they do. Well I mean there's no way they do that, but I meant in terms of putting you in a room with no cues for a while. The actress did a great job. I liked how they showed the shadows as her past trials.
