Speaker 1:	 Okay this little vignette follows a family. It began with the husband and wife, a mother and father moving into a little cottage. The film never leaves the cottage and it sort of jumps through time from them sort of setting up their life together, looks like it's about in the '70s to having a baby, apparently having a second baby. They indicate the time a little bit with the Nintendo 64 at one point but check out if it was probably the '80s or early '90s. I don't exactly remember. But they have these two kids. The marriage seems fine but then it seems like it's on the rocks a little bit, but they make it seem like maybe the husband left but then he's there and so I guess he didn't leave. They don't show a whole lot of what is such a big deal with the son except that he seems to be kind of a—I wanted to swear there for a second. But like a you know crappy kid and selfish kid and wants—so he moves out kind of apparently for no reason. Just that his dad kind of snaps at him. He shouldn't have—he should be a little more respectful. So overall it seems like a relatively normal family with a kind of crappy older boy who moves out for no reason and then at one point he comes back, and he drives away with the younger boy. In the meantime the younger boy sort of becomes unhappy with his family as well. He burns a photograph or a painting of some kind in a fireplace. He's upset with his parents. Overall it's—if he's fine and so it seems a little bit sad that everybody seems so unhappy because they have a nice house. And they didn't show any abuse or anything that would indicate that the two boys had any real reason to want to leave. They're also blond. The theme with these films a lot of white, not a lot of diversity in them in anything that I saw today. Everybody seems blond. This one seems maybe foreign. Not a lot of words but the words maybe were not in English and very seems to be a normal family.
