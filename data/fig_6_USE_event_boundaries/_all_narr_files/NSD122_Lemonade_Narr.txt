Speaker 1:	So the first thing I remember was that the thing when life gives you lemonade and then there is this sequence of events that you have to go through to eventually get the lemonade. The game or the sequence start from somewhere in the kitchen and then it follows to the bedroom and to the bathroom and then the office room and then goes outside. Somewhere along the line the camera starts shaking and the clock was changing too fast until after that the ball again keeps going. Huh, what else? When the camera man is recording everything inside the office there is another person on the top of the bed. And honestly what I thought is like someone must have a lot of free time to create this whole set up. I mean it takes a long time to put an effort, but it might have a meaning inside it. Meaning that like it might always—it might not be always easy to achieve what you want but if you're persistent and put enough effort and time in it you eventually achieve it. So I thought it might have like a meaning with it the video. Yeah, the design was really cool like the vibration on the phone, the water filling the container. There's the pendulum thing. It was interesting to follow where the ball goes next, which part of the house it goes. And at the end like when it got outside he had to—because it was really fast like he had to run to get to the finish line, to get to record the finish line. So overall it was a cool set up but takes a long time and it depends on how bad you want something to happen.
