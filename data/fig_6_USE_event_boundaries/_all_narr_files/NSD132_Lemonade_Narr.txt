So the video was a giant Rube Goldberg machine that went through somebody's house and backyard. I think the person that it came up on their phone I think it was Dr. Complicated. It was—consisted a lot of balls and rolling and pulleys going through the whole house. Starting in the kitchen, using a lot of household objects like spoons and cups and plates. Going from the cabinets over the sink to the door to eventually moving into the hallway and the bedroom. There were cars that were going down ramps and knocking into stuff with blocks or dominoes on the other side. That set off a chain reaction to keep it going. It was at one point a time lapse of slime dripping into a cup and that took a little bit to put together. Went into the bathroom. Came out then eventually went through pretty much all the rooms, the family room knocking over trash cans and making them roll further. And then it goes outside into the backyard, a soccer ball rolling into planks of wood, to a skateboard hitting another plank of wood that ended up having a pulley go from one end to another. And the videographer ran down to the other side, and it knocked something that started the lemonade to start pouring. One he filled the glass he pulled it out and the next thing of lemonade keeps going. And for me it's interesting to see these kind of contraptions and how they're made and it obviously takes many, many days to put together. A lot of math and testing to see how they would work and it's interesting to watch it all unfold and see the things that could be made with these household objects or toys that you can find around the house or at your local stores. And it's cool to see the types of things that these people can come up with and to create with these kind of objects and to entertain the public.
