All right, just hold on kid. So all right so I don't know what the hell's going on, but I mean I know that the—not the—yeah, I know that the brother character right, I mean he's a rat bastard. That's obvious. So you got like the time machine thing right? And it's quite obvious about it because it says it's a time machine at the end. But I don't know how's the time factor in there? Is she going down there before he does? Because I feel like she could do that without the time machine but obviously there's something more that I didn't pick up on because kind of not the greatest -- conditions being in a crazy machine here but hold on. I mean, he's a rat bastard. You could say something about how what—but I don't know. What is the mom doing, right? You got the scenes where the mom—it cuts to the mom, right? And she's just reading a book. I mean, what is that? What does that mean? And then you could also say something about look at what they're eating, it's like French fries and shit. But it doesn't mean anything. I mean, I think the most pervasive thought and I'm going to say it again. How much of a rat bastard that little rascal is. But I guess he came around, right? I just don’t understand the time machine factor, all right. Because really all I got out of that is—I didn't—let me just say I didn't like it like the whole movie there. I didn't not like it. It was interesting. It's a smart little rascal, the girl right? Obviously, I mean she like -- and I hope I can fix where I'll just say shed. She's -- and stuff. I don't know, smart guy and then that eight seconds. What a weasel.
