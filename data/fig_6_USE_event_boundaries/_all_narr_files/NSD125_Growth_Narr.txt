Speaker 1:	So the film was very well done. The lighting was I think amazing actually. The panning of the camera throughout the space was well articulated. I really liked the beginning in which they kind of just went through the house and just showed that it was very small. And then as towards the end of the film you could see that the house had changed. It became a much more open space, more of a home. I really like the progression of the storyline, the sons taking care of each other since the very beginning. It reminded me a lot of my brothers, my two older brothers. I also liked how the film touched upon the struggle between the parents and then how that affected one child and then the parents trying to remedy the situation tried their best to take care of the second child, the middle child. However this eventually led back to the same pattern of the child being ostracized really and his older brother taking him away from the parents to the parents' dismay. I actually really liked the concept with the light turning out or turning off during the scene where they're on the couch, the two brothers and the one brother consoling the other. I couldn't exactly see the details of the picture that the middle child burned in the fireplace. However I thought it was a really great symbolism especially when the older brother when he came home he recognized that the picture wasn't there anymore. You could see the despair on his face. I didn't really understand the black wall going into green possibly saying that this was such a dark time in the house and then becoming cheery again. However you could still see the black edges around the painting on the wall. So I thought that was pretty interesting. And even more so how the youngest child hopped into the truck without even saying goodbye to the parents. A very well-done film. Quite powerful.
