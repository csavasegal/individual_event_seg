At first I thought she was hallucinating, maybe that there was something wrong with her. Maybe she was in a hospital but when she got up and she started touching the light I was like okay, what's going on? And then it reminded me of a lot of other movies that I've watched like Infection or there was this like kind of -- movie that I watched which was kind of similar to this. And there's also the book called I Fall Apart I think which is about a girl who just dies over and over again, so it did remind me of that. I did think one minute was too short for her to be doing so much but her previous selfs kept on coming. Also I thought that did help her to meet that guy that she probably knew. I did think that because we could see faint shadows just lingering around maybe someone was watching them, but it was herself. I think it's kind of hard. Like this movie is very I don't know weird in a way because I don't think they'll be able to go out just like that waking up every minute just to wake up again for a minute, it's so tiring. So I feel like I definitely would have given up, but she didn’t which was pretty good I guess. The movie was interesting but that time when throughout the movie I could see okay, she's going to try. She doesn’t know what's going on and then she's going to get tired of everything and then she's going to try to get out and that's what kind of happened. It was interesting I did think that the place was a hospital, maybe it could have been like a psychiatric hospital. It could be that way. They're the only people left. They could be part of an experiment like I am right now. It was really weird but very good thing to watch. It was very interesting, very captivating.
