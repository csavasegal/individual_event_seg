Speaker 1:	Okay, the video was great but what is that mother doing? She obviously isn't giving enough food to her kids and what there isn't extra you know? And she doesn't even eat with the kids at the dinner table. And what kind of parent lets a child get away with that? I understand sibling rivalry. My brother used to do the same thing to me every now and again, but I always had extra food. I don't understand. Anyway I thought it was really interesting that film, very nice message. Really great ending. Kind of saw it coming a little bit but what really struck me as interesting is that they were using actual physics formulas and probability formulas inside the film. In the scene where the son was going and doing work with—and the daughter was doing all of the time machine building. It shows that he was trying to become smart, but she was just already smart which I thought was interesting. But what's up with the penguin timer? Just things like that which obviously I don't understand. But the daughter she's not physically apt as shown by the race but has a mind of a genius and it's just so interesting. My brother, my two older brothers were always more physically adept than I am, but I was always able to outsmart them. I really wasn't able with that with this film. And that parent didn't even teach the son how to be a good brother. I really hope I don't do that with my kids. I hope that they become best friends because that mother is just so absent. Is so noncommittal to the development of their kids. She didn't even recognize what's going on in their house like the lightning and the lighting electricity shortages, just crazy. She tried looking out but didn't even go investigate the noises outside her house. Maybe she's a single mother but still come on. Step the game up as a parent. That's really all I had to say about the film. Actually well, well shot just great.
