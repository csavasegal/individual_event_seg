Speaker 1:	 I thought the movie was very intriguing because I love sci-fi ones and I love time travel, anything that have to do with that. So the fact that she had to keep getting up to fight for wherever she wanted to go. I saw perseverance. I saw determination. I saw that she kept thinking about her next steps and she even went back and figured out that you know in order for me to get a drink of water I need to move fast. So problem-solving skills were also apparent and that she continued to use each room to uncover the next step to get out into the next room. I thought that the tree renewing itself was also like a way of understanding that everything is not what it appears to be. And even though the axe may be used to cut down the tree maybe it was needed to cut down something else in her life. And so it kind of brings back to our ability to understand that how to use tools in our lives to get to the next step in life. So sometimes you think that education is supposed to be used for one tool, but it may be just a steppingstone to get you to another room, to get you to another part of your life. It's not necessarily the way that you think that it's supposed to be used in the initial so. I thought that her problem-solving skills and that she got to a place even though the movie didn’t show the end of do they get out ever or not? I thought that her problem-solving skills were good and understanding how to use up her time wisely, time management, determination, perseverance through judgement calls. I did not see where she got weary but for a moment one time that she turned and just like almost gave up but then that thought kind of went away. Said no, I'm going to get up and figure it out and I admire her for her perseverance not to roll over too long. Because I think we all get there to a point where we go like you know this life is too rough. I'm going to give up, but she didn't, and I admire her. Good movie.
