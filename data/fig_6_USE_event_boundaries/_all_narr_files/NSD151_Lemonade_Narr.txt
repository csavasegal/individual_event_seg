So that video was of a Rube Goldberg machine probably the most complicated one that I've ever seen. The theme was when life gives you lemons make lemonade to do so in a very complex roundabout way. My impressions were first they had done the whole video in one take. And so I was thinking to myself I wonder how many takes they had to do to get this? And how far they got in a take and then had a component fail? And then when I saw the phone I thought oh no, don't bring computers into this. The second impression that I had was they had filled their entire house with contraptions probably to the point where it was unlivable. And was thinking to myself that their significant other or their parents or whatever family that they live with was probably unhappy with them for that. Some of the more interesting components that caught my attention I especially liked the pinball where each pinball that was released went through the maze and in doing so triggered the release of the next pinball. And they gradually sequentially, successively build in space so that the very last pinball could pass over that space. There were lots of balls and erector sets. --. It seemed that they had used just about everything that was available to them in the house --. I guess the -- revealing thought in my mind was how many takes they had to do and how long they had to spend to set it up and to prepare it?
