Speaker 1:	This is a story about a dysfunctional family. It starts off in the mid '70s, early '80s. And they get a house, and they have a painting and it's all done in one shot for the first half of it. And so as they skim around the house it shows the wife being pregnant and then them having a kid. And then it goes to the kid's fifth birthday and then there's another kid. And then they're happy and they decide to start remodeling the house. As they start remodeling the house some issues between the parents arise and the kid isn't—the younger kid isn't happy, and the older kid tries to comfort him. Throughout the entirety of this there's a lot of focus on the house next door which I'm assuming is just them thinking about a different life that they could have had. And so the parents are arguing in the kitchen for one part and then the eldest son gets older, and he gets in a fight with the father, and he doesn't want to live there anymore. So he moves out with a box and the mother's very upset about it. It looks like she's the person who like placates everyone in the family. And so she tries to stop him from leaving and he leaves with the box moving out. And then they give the younger brother—the dad tries to buy him off with gifts, a Nintendo 64 which came out in 1996 so we're in the '90s now. And the boy's maybe 12, 13 years old and then it does a passage of time again which in this is like no time at all. And he comes back with a woman, and he has a present as if it's her—someone's birthday. He comes in and the mother greets him like she usually does but happier and then he ignores his father. He goes to his brother. The brother ignores him, playing on his phone I think or maybe a video game. And then he—so he ignores him for a little bit and then he tells his brother he's going to take him with him or something like that and then they leave together.
