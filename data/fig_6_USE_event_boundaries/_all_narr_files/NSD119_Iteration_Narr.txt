Speaker 1:	Yeah, so there's absolutely no way I'm talking that long about this film unless I just keep saying the same thing over and over again. I found this film to be like frustrating. It was kind of like being in a video game and getting so far and then trying again and again and again except it was like a human and imagining living through that was tiring. Pretty sure I would have put an axe through the wall the first time. The tree would have been entirely like a project not able to be done in that amount of time or probably ever. I didn't expect to see another person. Of course that and if you want to call it the end it still seemed to be in the middle of the maze or whatever it was. The film itself was kind of bright. It was very white. This felt—I just felt overwhelmed I guess throughout the film like there was just no way out. Pretty sure I would have been in the bed a lot sooner than her, just not wanting to get up at all. Kind of weird to have more than one person appear repeatedly. That was kind of cool. And that's about it I guess. Different way in the balloon room I thought she had a prop all those balloons of hers. I didn't realize there was going to be a few.
