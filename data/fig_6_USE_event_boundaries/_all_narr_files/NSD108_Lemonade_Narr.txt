Speaker 1:	 It's going to be hard to talk about that for three minutes but it's one of those mouse trapey things that you set up a very elaborate contraption to do something very simple. In this case it was apparently pouring a glass of water or orange juice. There were so many steps that I can't even begin to start remembering how it started. But there were—I'll just talk generally. There were balls and a lot of rolling to connect to brand Lego thingies to have the balls roll around and at one point a cell phone was ringing and fell off the table which was kind of excruciating to watch slowly. I liked that it appeared to be just some guy. At one point you could see his like dirty laundry in the part of the room and like an iPad sitting around which made me think that it was probably real. Although that'd be extremely elaborate, and I don't know how you could have possibly had that actually work in real time. At one point we had to watch a big bucket of water get filled up, had been spilled out and made some more balls go. And it was a guy that was filming it, you can see him in the mirror. There were big balls. There were little balls. Both the most complicated and elaborate film that I've watched but also kind of simple. I found myself kind of falling asleep even though it was also kind of the most enthralling in a way. So kind of an odd film that way. I'm impressed the kid's ingenuity. I can't believe I have another 47 seconds to fill. He was white. I don't know. I guess I noticed that at one point and lives in California. I feel like maybe I recognized the where he lived because kind of up in the hills in Southern California it looked like to me anyway. The outside shot was kind of interesting in that respect. I'm impressed at the kid's ability to pour a glass of lemonade in an extremely complicated way.
