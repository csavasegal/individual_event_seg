Speaker 1:	Wow, so that was cool. I was equally impressed that it was a handheld camera that he was shooting it on. So if something did go wrong he would be able to just do it again and pick it up at the same point. Whenever something—one of the gadgets took longer than normal I tended to like lose my focus. I wasn't exactly sure what was happening or paying attention to what was going to happen next. I did notice on the longest section where there was like some kind of goo or something that he time lapsed it with the camera in the background. You could see that he had sped it up, so it actually took a lot longer than it felt like it did. Curious like how long it takes to set that up? How long it actually took for the whole thing to run its course? How many times he had to do it before it got right? How you could possibly know that all that would happen like the phone like ringing enough times that he would vibrate off of the binder. Also just that nothing went wrong with shooting it. There wasn't a dog barking or when you walked outside the lighting changed so significantly that you couldn't see something. I was—I felt kind of stressed watching it like something might go wrong or it wasn't going to go through the whole way. There's one section I think it might have been in a bathroom. I thought there were two. I didn't realize there was a mirror with an image. It was just cool that it went all the way through the entire house. I would assume that you'd have to live alone in order to even set that up. I did notice that there was a picture with the people in it. But again like just it seemed to go through the entire house and then I was surprised that it went outside. It was just it was a cool video. Neat that you could shoot it the whole way through with all the different rooms too.
