It was actually frustrating to watch this movie because I to be honest I didn't quite understand what the story about, and I didn't really understand about this movie. But if I was in her situation I would definitely not like it because there's no way out. You're in the room alone and very frustrating situation. But and I wasn't sure if she was just dreaming or if it was actually happening to her. It was actually very hard for me to understand about this movie. And when she at the end she threw the hammer on the wall because of her frustration she made the hole and then she was able to create the big hole. And then from that hole the another person, the guy appeared and then like he was experiencing the same problem. So they found in common and I'm sure she felt much better now that she's not alone and he also felt better. And yeah, it was just very weird movie, and I would definitely not want to be in that situation, very interesting. I don't know if it was only me who didn’t understand the movie maybe some other people I guess understand. But this movie wasn't really for me, it was uncomfortable movie to watch.
