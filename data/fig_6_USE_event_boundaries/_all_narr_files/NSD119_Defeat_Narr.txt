Speaker 1:	So this started with the kid, the boy being a real jerk, taking food from his sister and just a bully overall. But even before I kind of realized what was going on crime seems to be a focal part of the film. They showed the calendar a lot and a clock and even the timer on the counter. There was a lot of passage of time. And then she seemed to be really smart and really determined to do something. I wasn't quite sure what she was trying to build but it was kind of cool that is was a time machine given the way that they showed time throughout the whole film. And awesome the way that she had to get back at her brother and -- him and got really smart in the process. Noticed there didn't seem to be a dad in the house. I'm not sure if that's why the kid was a jerk but certainly didn't slow her down from learning anything, reading and welding and all of the other stuff. Just that the brother was a big jerk, and the sister was super smart, and it was very cool to see her win out in the end. The natural sound in this film was strong as it was in the last one. The colors were pretty vibrant. It had a good feel to the whole film. There were less characters in this film, but it held my attention better than the last one. I think just because of trying to figure out what was going on was much more interesting and had a better feel to it. And I think the colors had something to do with that. That was much more colorful and bright than the last film.
