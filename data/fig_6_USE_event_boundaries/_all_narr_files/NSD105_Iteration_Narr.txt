Speaker 1:	 The girl wakes up, starts to be confused about where she is. Then she starts to—she spills the water. Then makes her way over to the pad. She steps on the pad, eventually that pulls the door. Then she makes her way to the next door which I believe has the balloons. And that's then—oh, before that she had several iterations I think are of the girl— other spirits or something or other iterations of the person. And then she starts to move to the next chamber if you will, that is the balloons unsure if she has to pop all of them. And then other iterations of her are popping them and she finds a key in the balloon. Then the key brings her to the next room which is the tree. And after she fails to get to the tree, fails to chop the tree down with the axe then she uses the axe to break the wall, but I think the wall brings her to the next room, the next chamber. That is where she meets up with the other guy. Then it leads to them at some point then go and use the axes to hit other walls in the chamber. All the while I assume that they after time runs out have other iterations of themselves using the process, using what they've learned. At some point one of the iterations the person spilling the water, the woman drank the water. The whole thing often reminded me of the movie Groundhog's Day. He's starting over doing everything in repeat in a loop. And next we have at some point the tree grew back after she used the axe on it which at some level of frustration. In one iteration the woman does not wake up, does not want to wake up and get out of bed. The movie did not really relate of how that worked out. The various iterations, the room with the pink balloons. The tree room, then the tree room happens to be the room with the meeting with the other gentleman. Then with the gentleman they run into the overall view of the -- shape pattern of all the other rooms connected and then the movie ends.
