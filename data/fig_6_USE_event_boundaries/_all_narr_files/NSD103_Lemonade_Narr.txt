Speaker 1:	Okay, I remember the very beginning was about when life gives you lemons and in the end it's the background you have lemonade. The course is set up probably throughout most of the house and it has a lot of --. So there's one part was really interesting how they got the phone to call the other one and to fall off. I don't know totally how they did that. Also thinking about how hard that must have been to film the first thing went around trying to get all of it. I wondered a lot about all the time to set it up. Just think of all the different parts of it. So it seems like at the beginning there was a lot of thick plastic, -- to film and ball drop things that you see in their videos that got a lot more complicated as it went on. They used --. They had water going. Nobody turned off the sink which I was thinking about for a little bit after they filled up the lemonade container. There were no characters, so I don't know how to talk about that, I guess other than the person filming. Even more than it was at the end just a continuous thing of the course because it continued on and so that was interesting. I started thinking a little bit about what goes into designing one of those and the time it would take to do it. There's no other different events. They're just following it along. I'm trying to remember some of the other things that they included other than just the drops and the phone and he's just flying outside which is kind of --. I don't know how they got that --. There was a tracking -- at one point which they used gravity to get the ball to go through the maze. I can't remember the other just that -- but it looks like a lot of effort and was interesting.
