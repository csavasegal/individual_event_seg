I thought the entire process was extremely wonderful, elaborate. And I actually appreciated the fact that in whatever room they were in the person was using appliances or items that could be found in those rooms. The amount of time and preparation and trial and error that was needed to complete the entire process it must have been mind-numbing. It was very interesting to see the amount of tracks and different items used throughout the entirety of the house. That was very cool. As far as the end result just for a cup of lemonade I'd say there could have been a lot more simpler things that he could have done could have possibly ended it sooner. I appreciated the time lapses and the amount of use of cinematography. I'm not sure if that's appropriate in this sense. I think that was a single camera handheld, but I guess he also knew to make room because the gentleman also knew to make room for himself in order to capture all of the course for the ball and the rolls of toilet paper and other things throughout his course. I'm not sure how much else I could say as far as that. I was curious to know though how he knew exactly how many rings it would take for his phone to slide off of the binder. Also I would like to know if—well yeah, I think that's all I have to say in regards to this. The time, in the event that it did rain outside how would that have affected his project? And would he have had to prepare that right before he started the whole process or was it somewhat ahead of time making sure no wind or rain or anything like that? Maybe squirrels running amuck would have affected the end of the track.
