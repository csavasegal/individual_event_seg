All right, so I don't know what the hell's going on again. You got some sort of dysfunctional family. The scene going on there and it's like each boy's turn to be edgy. I didn't really like see any —it was a very—it was very tense and kind of foreboding. That's a word you could use right all throughout. You got your little— you see the whole history like the house right when it's just the couple that comes in. they got the kids that works and, but I didn't really see any like there wasn't any trauma or anything you could say that you could directly attribute to. I'd say the first boy's sort of I don't know behavior right? I don't know what's going on. It just kind of ends there. I feel like the father's just kind of— you got the two scenes—you got two scenes right where each for each boy. Well one scene for each boy there who's kind of going out leaving the house one way or another. And you see—yeah, the father doesn't really—I mean neither of the parents really make all that much of an effort to kind of I don't know stop it. Especially the father figure there you got really the mother's the only one kind of you'll see her grabbing on to the kids and whatnot. I feel like the—something I noticed kind of lack of any real understandable dialogue that for me at least there I couldn't—I didn't hear anything go on talking wise I did feel like that is intentional. You got the Nintendo 64 there and that's something but trying to win the boy over. But it's like why? Why did both of them? I mean it's kind of understandable right why the second, the younger brother there could be in a bad mood there. But it's like what set off the first one right? So the younger brother convinces him to leave.
