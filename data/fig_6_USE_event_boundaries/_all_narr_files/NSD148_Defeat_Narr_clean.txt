So first the mother cook, heat up the dinner for the kids for Tommy and Tiny. And Tommy seems like always to be on time to steal Tiny's food. Seems like it's a bunch of food Tommy always, he's a selfish kid to take the spot even for the people who were handicapped. And also there was a running race between Tommy and Timmy's classmates and Tommy purposely distracted Tiny, so he could have started on time and finish that race before everyone else and his sister. Tiny had enough of Tommy's selfishness so she decided to come up with a formula to invent a time machine so she can always be on time for eating dinner at 6:00. But while she would at night she would overnight -- that they had and after that -- she made that she was able to create a time machine that she can travel from 5:55 to 6:00 PM and to be on time to steal her brother's food. So he cannot—he can get there before her. And Tommy noticed that too that she was happy that that worked at the end, that made him -- to be what's going on? He went over to Tiny's room to get what she was doing, see what's going on and on. He noticed that Tiny was working on the time machine, and she was able to travel from 5:55 to 6:00 PM. And she was able to get to the dinner table before Tommy was able to after their mom called for dinner. Tommy seemed like a selfish kid that wanted to take opportunities to take advantage of all the other -- that he had. But Tiny is like the type of kid that she was going to solve a problem like -- her problem.
