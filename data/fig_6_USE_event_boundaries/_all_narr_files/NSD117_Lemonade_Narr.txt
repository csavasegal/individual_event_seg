Speaker 1:	Well the first image that you—that I saw when the video started was the lemons which actually I don't know why but it just made me think of that quote when life gives you lemons make lemonade. Well it just made me think of a quote from a book that I read by—actually I can't remember his name. But it's actually about when life gives you lemons some like them lemons. Long thing but I thought about the book that I read like a year ago. Then at first I thought it was awfully satisfying. I've always thought that was so cool and I would never have the patience to make something like that because it looks like it took forever to me just because it took forever to end. After a while actually for some parts I thought they were super creative. Some other parts I was very confused on how it worked. Like when the laptop is involved and somehow that has something to do with where everything's going. I was confused. But after a little while I started to feel frustrated because I just wanted to know what the big finale was which now looking back it makes sense that it started with the quote when life gives you lemons make lemonade to literally making lemonade. So that was interesting. Also I was not expecting it to go outside, that was cool. I really enjoyed when he—I was always wondering who would have the patience to do that while I was watching it. And whenever he's recording and passes by a mirror that was cool because I got to see who actually had the patience to go through all of that. I know I could never which actually makes me think that I'm really glad I didn't go into engineering like I wanted to before I started college because I don't have the patience I guess. Also I thought about all the mess that he was going to have to clean up. I don't like a bunch of stuff all over the place and I just wanted to clean it up.
