I did think it was a really cool video. It's just a lot. I feel like if I did that at home my mom would come after me. I mean that's a lot for just a cup of lemonade. I mean I know that's a hobby, and that's what he likes to do, and I totally respect it. But in my opinion I do feel like it's a lot especially just I'm imagining like cleaning that up by myself after I do it just for a cup of lemonade. Well still thinking that it was very cool of him to use a lot of resources but for at home. I was like while looking at the video I was trying to think of my apartment and being like do I have this? Do I have that? If I did that at my place what would it look like? And I literally don't have any toys like the speed racing cars that he has and just the other stuff that he has I mean respect but that was a lot. Very creative, did a lot of what he wanted to do. He used his resources well I feel like. It was kind of long in my opinion. I felt like it didn't need to be this long. Especially the top thing part in his bathroom if I recall correctly. That was kind of so-so. I feel like I kind of dozed off there but interesting video overall. I do think he did a good job of just showing about how creative he could be which was interesting like how he used every single corner of his house. Then I like how he did outside and he was running to get it on film so that was cool too. Other than that I don't think I'm really interested in this kind of stuff, so it was hard for me to like focus and be like that's cool. I think after the first 10 seconds I was just like okay. I'm done with that. But other than that it was pretty cool in my opinion.
