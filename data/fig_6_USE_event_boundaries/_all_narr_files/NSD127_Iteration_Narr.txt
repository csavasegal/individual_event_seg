So this video was sort of a surreal futuristic experience in which a youngish woman is in—starts out in a solitary room in a bed. And every time she wakes up she has just 50 seconds before she collapses and then has to repeat what—it keeps basically repeating over and over again and each time she wakes up she's attempting to escape from this room or building or whatever she's trapped in. And eventually she makes her way through after many attempts. The first room she figures out how to escape the room with the bed and gets to a room with balloons. At first she thinks she needs to pop all the balloons to get to the next room but then realizes if she pops the balloon that has a key in it she'll be able to exit. She figures that out and every time that she collapses, wakes up in bed she makes more progress. She gets to a room with a tree and an axe. At first she attempts she starts chopping up the tree and her other iterations of herself help but then eventually she realizes she can actually just use the axe to try to break through the wall which she does. Once she learned she could do that she meets up with a man who's having the same experience elsewhere in this world. And so basically they're trying—it seems as though they either are reuniting, or they've been in this experience for so long that they're sharing this experience and they're just it seem like they're just trying to make their way out. The woman at some point is sort of depressed and frustrated, just sort of gives up but ultimately she continues on to try to make her way through. And then at the end we basically see a shot, like a pulled out and you realize there are many different rooms. And it seems like maybe this experience is something she's imagining or dreaming or it's unclear whether this—she's trapped or she's stuck.
