Speaker 1:	So I remember that the brother was too mean and jerk, but the girl is like a genius working on all those mathematic equations to try to work something out and she made a time machine I guess. So the brother's character is so mean, and the girl was smart. And then the why the mother never checked on them that was a question. She just put the food and left is so bizarre but at the end she took her revenge I guess. So she taught him a lesson. Yeah, so all those things that he did to him build up and she finally, hopefully for the other situation she was going to like think of something smart so she can always be ahead of him or stop him from acting that way. So I --. I don’t know where the father. Where's the father in the picture? Yeah, the mother set the same timing for food every day and the food seems to be the same for every meal, French fries but that's not a healthy diet for kids. And yeah, sometimes she's different than her brother. She's got two different personalities, and this is they were too different.
