That was a good thing. It was nice that this little girl it was this -- being very bullied by her older brother. It wasn't like she took it out on him probably or anything. It was just -- to come up with kind of movie -- an astrophysicist and just made a time travel machine. But just kind of horrible to watch the brother being such an unpleasant person. And when the -- is bullying and not just to his sister but also to the kid who limps with the crutches who the sister was trying to be nice to. And it was just surprising that nobody—I guess there weren't really that many other characters in the film. Well, there was a mother, but nobody seemed to pay attention to that or pick up on that. I think that the mother would pay attention to how much food her children are eating but the only thing -- I guess. Maybe she didn't really know what they were eating. And it was also kind of a darker film, it was like I almost thought that something bad was going to happen when the lights are flickering, and the music got kind of a little bit dark. But I guess it was just the girl was creating a time machine, not like she's trying to murder her brother. That was nice. Yeah, I would—I don't know. At the end she just seemed to be like, I'm better than you were and figured it out. But if she had a time machine I'm not sure if she went back in time -- more or two bullies brought her back would he have been aware that he had been the bully before? Anyway, it was nice. It wasn't dark but most of --.
