Well when this video started I was curious to know what the woman was cooking and who she was cooking it for. And then when the two kids came to go to the table to eat and the boy went first, and he took food from the other plate to put on his own, I found it a little comical because that's something that my younger brother would do to me when we were growing up. I felt really bad in the bus scene when the girl offered the seat to the handicapped boy but then the brother went to take the seat. I felt like too this movie wasn’t really it didn't have any language between the characters, but it was able to express emotion through the music. And even during the when the kids were racing it seemed like the brother tried to kind of cheat his sister by distracting her before the race started. And that and the scene for the bus got me thinking about how children who grow up in the same home can kind of grow up to have different personalities. So I was kind of thinking about that for a little bit throughout the movie. And then additionally I thought it was a little weird how a girl that young was able to make an entire time machine. And I thought it was interesting that when she was able to go back in time she did it so she was the one who got more food on the plate. I thought it would had been nice if it ended with that being more equal so and I felt like the movie kind of cut a little short in terms of that. I was also by hearing the mom's voice it being it sounded like the characters grew up in the United Kingdom. And I feel like I know this may sound weird, but I feel like the UK always makes little short films like this so at the beginning I thought about that. And, I guess the main message that I got from this movie was to be kind to others otherwise it'll kind of come back to you in some way.
