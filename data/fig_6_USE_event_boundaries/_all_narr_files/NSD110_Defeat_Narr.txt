Speaker 1:	 Absolutely amazing. Every single second of that little movie was just absolutely perfection. The pettiness that it takes to build a machine that defies the laws of physics simply so you can get more oven-baked French fries than your chunky brother is such an all-time move by Tiny that I mean this deserves awards. It had a little bit of everything. A marginally overweight jerk of an older brother who takes the food, who seemingly takes a seat from what looks like a physically handicapped kid on a bus just really building the narrative that this kid is a real piece of work. And then the mom seemingly not noticing that her daughter is sneaking out to the shed at night, where I guess the mom keeps particle physics equipment or at least the stuff you need to make particle physics equipment because that's a normal thing that most of us have in our shed. And then Tiny understanding advanced level of calculus and physics equations at what can't be older than seven or eight years old. And really being a true underdog story of this whole thing. Not winning the race, just kind of not having it go her way for a big old bulk of that movie. And then the us the viewer not really knowing what she's up to the entire time, just knowing that she's apparently doing very complex mathematics and building, soldering, jump starting some kind of device in her bedroom. And then in just an absolutely like perfectly executed conclusion slash climax to the movie of the power being drawn from the house and the chunky older brother waiting desperately on dinner. And then after building a time machine she doesn't just do anything with it, she goes back five minutes that's it. Five minutes in time so that she can beat Tommy downstairs and load up her food or her plate with what honestly looked like rather unappetizing food. Just absolutely perfection. Loved every second of that movie.
