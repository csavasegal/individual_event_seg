Speaker 1:	 So the video started out with the phrase when life gives you lemons and the whole cascade began with the rolling of the lemon. There was a whole series of events that involved toys and all sorts of stuff that eventually led to making lemonade. I guess it's just a really long metaphor for that if you're handed a certain difficult situation in life it might take you some time, it might require some patience for you to get where you're looking to go. But you can and are able to eventually if you're persistent enough to turn that into something productive and beautiful. Apart from that the video's kind of long. It made me kind of restless. I was waiting for the end. It was still really fun to watch. Certain parts were repetitive. It probably took a lot of time for them to create, and I think that that is impressive. The lemonade looked good. I think the videographer did a good job following the events. It seemed like a lot to keep up with especially with a bunch of balls and -- rolling around quickly. I wondered how the metal balls were following such a straight path. I thought maybe there were magnets, the wood blocks are magnets or maybe those gray bars are magnets. That was a question that I was wondering about.
