Speaker 1:	So the video looked like it was about a newly wed couple that moves into their first home. Shortly after the wife gets pregnant with the first child, then they have another child. Both are boys. They shows a birthday scene for the second child looks like. Afterwards they start remodeling the house and the parents start running into some marital issues. The mom and dad start fighting. It starts affecting the kids. Oldest brother looks like he leaves the house maybe goes to serve in the military. He had on dog tags. The youngest kid looks like he's less affected. He's still at the house. He's not happy. His older brother comes back to come and get him. The parents aren't happy with it. They try to like make him happy by buying him a Nintendo 64, make the little boy happy. And then they fight with the older brother to try to keep him from taking the younger brother away. But he ends up taking the younger brother with him. There's some lady in the car with him. I don't know who that is. There was also some scene with a house and a woman in the window of the house across the street. I'm not sure what that was about. I think that was it for the plot. It seems like an average turn of events for a family. I guess in the end I think that the little brother at least had his older brother to look out for him and take care of him and take him away from the toxic environment that seems to be his parents' relationship. And hopefully the parents worked their stuff out afterwards. Hopefully the brothers heal from that trauma.
