Wow, that's the best one of those I've seen. I wonder who designs things like this? Not to be like cynical or critical or anything but it just seems like this would take months of effort and in all likelihood a point of thinking about this -- small. So but I mean maybe there are people that are more entertained by this sort of thing than myself. As far as the metaphor for the life gives you lemons trying to perhaps over analyzing but maybe it's saying like the ends justifies the means perhaps. Though I would kind of like more interpret it as the journey is just as important as the result. Even though I'm not a physics person so I don't find these things amazing. Man, I got a lot of respect from an art perspective on how this was designed and thought out. And, I mean I want to see—I know whoever did this is really good at like because if he can design something like that I mean he can really do anything. But then again it's people who do all these types of things maybe they're easily distracted and so they do something like this. Make a video for people's entertainment and to be shown in FMRIs for neurological experiments.
