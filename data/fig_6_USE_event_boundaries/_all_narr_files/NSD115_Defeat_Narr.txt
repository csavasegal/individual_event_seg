Speaker 1:	So this short film stars Tommy and Tiny who are a brother and sister. It starts off with a penguin egg timer and a mom who very punctually makes dinner I believe it's 5:55. So the bell will go off. She'll pull out fish and chips or some derivation of it. It seems like this is a UK film. They're all wearing primary school outfits. Don't see a dad around so it's just the two kids. Mom doesn't seem to notice that Tommy's kind of a jerk to his little sister. So it's just like any younger sibling she's patiently plotting her revenge against her selfish brother who's kind of a jerk. It even shows he's kind of a jerk to I guess a kid who has I guess walkers. He won't let -- the bus and then he distracts his sister during a race so that he can easily win. I really like the use of lighting in this. It's very dark, very darkly lit in the kid's rooms so you get the sense of kind of they're both kind of their own internal worlds. And in hers you know there's a pretty extensive kind of silent piano montage where she's doing a bunch of math calculations. And it's pretty clear from just the egg timer to the clocks, the watches kind of foreshadows that she's building some kind of time machine so she can transport herself back in time and -- one step ahead of her brother and kind of get back at him. So kind of interesting. I expected a little bit more pay off at the end there. It seemed like she just wanted -- dinner time but then you seem to forget the seat on the bus or to win the race or to do a number—any number of things in front of him. I'm always kind of second guessing you're wondering why is everyone so behind me. So this was a good film again. I liked the lighting kind of outside it's really bright contrasted with the evening time where it's really dark and kind of lit by fluorescent lighting.
