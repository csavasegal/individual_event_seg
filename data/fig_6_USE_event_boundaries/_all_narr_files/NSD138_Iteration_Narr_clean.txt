So what I just watched it's like a sci-fi short film about a woman who woke up in a strange white mysterious room. She woke up and she didn't know where she was it looked like, and she didn't know—she seemed mostly confused. And the announcer or whatever is leading the test facility gives an announcement of saying that there is 60 seconds, no explanation of why or what that means. Through several iterations of trial and error the woman figures out how to get to the next room and in the next room she sees a bunch of balloons. And there's no directions, no instructions, anything on what to do. It seems like whatever test facility she's stuck in it's I guess testing her ability to figure things out on her own. So in that room with the balloons one of the balloons contains a key to the next room but she can't figure out which balloon it is because there's hundreds of balloons dropping down in her room at once. Through several more iterations she discovers that the first balloon that drops is the one that contains the key to the next room. So she quickly identifies that balloon and enters the next room in which she sees and encounters a big tree and an axe. What she initially thinks of assumes that she's supposed to cut down the tree. She soon realizes that that's not the case at all and whether she's to think outside the box and to rather than cut down the tree that's in front of her, to cut down the walls that are surrounding her. Eventually she meets up with another what I assume to be a test contestant or a person who is also undergoing these weird tests. And she meets this man and eventually they start working together to break down the other walls at the facility. In general this film had a very mysterious and kind of a what's happening feeling to it, and I liked it. I liked that we had as much information as the characters had.
