But this could be a heart-warming timeless classic. Was like a mixture between Cube, Happy Death Day and Don Quixote. Really enjoyed the way the plot thickened as the film progressed. I really thought it was going to be a lesson in perseverance but it kind of ended up being a lesson in critical thinking and thinking outside the box or outside the cube in this case.  My ex-wife would have really liked this movie. She loves this type of stuff and I really—that was cool how. Like the way when they set up things in this sort of fantasy type way, you really don't know what to expect and if I was a filmmaker. I guess it's kind of like it gives you unlimited creative control, visual creator to do these sorts of films. And what genre is this called? Because there's a lot of other types of movies like this. Then there wasn't a whole—there was less character development I'd say than the other films. It was like a change of pace from the last two. That tree scene that was something else. But, no it was—I knew that was going to happen when they found another person in the simulation. I'm tempted to think that there was actually an idea behind this film, but I also think that the maker may have just been making it up as they went along, and they just wanted to see what they could do in the editing and filming. It didn't really invoke a lot of emotion like the other pieces.
