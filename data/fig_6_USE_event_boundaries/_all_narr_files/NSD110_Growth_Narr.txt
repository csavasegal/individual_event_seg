Speaker 1:	 Okay, I'm not totally sure what the message was here besides parents are really, really capable of screwing up their kids. It started seemingly pretty happy. A young couple appears to buy their first house, to have their first kid. And then I guess it kind of shifts to the theme of the dad working too much because the mom seemingly has the young baby around by herself. But then when they showed the kid's birthday the dad seems to be there. It all seems happy. The second kid comes along and seems quite lovely. Brother looking after little brother. They remodel the house, that seems to cause some tension with the folks. And then I guess the other theme here is that technology's not great through this whole thing either because it shows a lot of images of the kids sitting in front of the TV while the parents are pretty disengaged. And that's sort of when they lost me theme wise because from there it seemed like the kids got progressively older and progressively less and less happy. The dad seemed to become more and more disconnected, more and more focused on his work rather than the family. It seemed like there was the implication at one point that one of the parents was cheating with the neighbor, not really sure who or what they were going for there. But the kids are looking longingly out the window while it looks like the neighbor there's someone up in the bedroom or something like that. And then after a blow up with the dad over dinner from some bubbling tension it seemed the older brother storms out. Seems to really upset the mom. The parents try to console the remaining brother with like a video game console and it's a pretty half-hearted empathy. And then I guess older brother comes back to save the day and take his younger brother away from these two emotionally disconnected parents. That's the best I could get out of that is parents be engaged with your kids.
