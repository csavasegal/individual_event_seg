Speaker 1:	 So it starts out with a young couple going up to their new house. I assume they're recently married. They've just bought a house and the movie sort of goes through their lives very fluidly. So they start out by going into their new house and then we see them unpacking their things. And then the next scene is the woman is sitting in the chair pregnant. And then moves to the next scene where she has a baby, she's going for a baby. And then we see the baby at a—we see the kid's birthday party, his fifth-year birthday party. And then the next thing we see is there are two kids another boy. So there's now two brothers and then we just see little snippets of their life as they grow up. It seems like the two parents are artists because we see with stencils and easels and then we also see the mom painting the house at one point. And then at one point they add on to the house so there's a big addition to the house. And then we see the boys growing up. We see they have a pug. And we see the boys doing homework and eventually they grow up to be teenagers. And it seems like the older son does not get along with the dad too well. There seems to be some tension. Eventually the older son grabs a box and moves out it seems. And then it seems like the younger son is upset and probably lonely that his brother has moved out. So eventually we see the older son come back with what seems like a girlfriend to visit and he's cordial with his mom but then is kind of awkward with the dad. And then it seems like he convinces the younger son to leave with him. So both sons leave. The mom tries to prevent the younger son from leaving. And then the last scene of the film is you see the younger son going into the truck with the older son and a girlfriend.
