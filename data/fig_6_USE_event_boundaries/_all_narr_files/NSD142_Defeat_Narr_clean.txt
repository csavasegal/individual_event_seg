Okay, so this movie was a little bit upsetting and a little bit uncomfortable to watch at the beginning because the boy, the girl's brother was mean to her almost like bully. I remember him putting the French fry and the pizza more food to his plate so that his sister get less food. But the sister didn’t even complain, she looked sad, but she didn't say anything, and I was thinking because I have kids. So I was thinking if that was my kids they would definitely complain saying that, mommy he put my—he took my food, and they would just scream and complain but she didn't do that. Even when her brother cheated when they were running she didn't say anything. She just was sad. But it seems like the girl invented some invention, some kind of machine to change the things around and that kind of made me feel good. So that she could be actually good. She was doing the same thing to his brother that his brother was doing to her. So at the beginning I was frustrated because the boy was mean to the girl but now things should turn. Now she's doing the same thing that he did to her and I'm sure that made her feel good but at the same time that boy felt how she was feeling when he was doing that to her. So overall it was an interesting movie to watch. I was worried at the beginning that she was—she didn't say anything to her brother. She was just keeping her feelings inside so I felt like maybe she would explode later but she found a way to figure out how to.
