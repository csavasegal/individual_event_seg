Speaker 1:	I really enjoyed this one. It gave off a kind of a sci-fi vibe to it. It definitely reminded me of Groundhog Day which unfortunately I have not seen the whole thing. But I understand the premise to it and the idea of stuck in a loop is very common in a lot of movies. For example Doctor Strange the ending he sets a time loop. So he finds a mobster gets killed, repeats it over and over again. So this is very similar to that. It seems like a futuristic world where the main character the woman is stuck in bed. She has an announcer that tells her what time—which attempt is this? And then we just see her basically try to what a human does, rage against the world that -- such as time and whatnot and try to do her own bit. And of course with her sadly it's futile most of the time. There's you know she did more and more dramatic things but still ended up in bed. So there's the one where she's her other parts of herself to help cut down a tree which is really cool. The tree seemed like it was connected that that was a source of all problems in that building but that didn't seem to do much. And at the end she ends up going with her the guy that. So she out with him in the end. I think she got up to the 100th attempt and at that point she was ready to give up. She just stayed in bed. There were some of maybe even feeling depressed, very hopeless not in control of your life. Those are usually the signs that somebody's depressed or has low self-esteem. And then just out of pure luck she ends up throwing the axe and it opens the screen a little bit and that's how she ends up finding that there's another guy, other person going through the same loop. Except the guy he's right next to her. So it makes you wonder if this whole building is just full of people in each room, they're all being tested. That would be a really cool insight to consider, to think about.
