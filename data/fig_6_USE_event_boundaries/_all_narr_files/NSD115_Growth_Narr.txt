Speaker 1:	So this short film takes place in one room, the living room in a house. You don't see what the house looks like. You can see the house across the street. It has a thatched roof. Looks like something probably filmed in New Zealand. The family is—it starts out with a husband and wife in an essentially empty room. As the camera pans you can see the husband and wife embracing each other, unpacking boxes and the mother to be is sitting in a rocking chair holding her stomach. And then it pans to her holding a child slowly using passage of time. As one son becomes two eventually transitioning to night you can see the two boys sitting watching Voltron on the television. And then as they get older and then the older son is watching the younger. It seems like the younger son has kind of autism or some kind of inability to communicate. So he's obviously very protective of his brother but doesn't seem to get along with the dad very much. They're watching Sound of Music during Christmas and he's fiddling with something on the dining room table and the dad explodes. And I guess he's had enough, walks away from the table. And eventually pack his belongings and leaves the house. The mother wanting to -- he ends up doing so and then time passes and the camera point of view switches to the youngest son. The mom and dad try to placate him with a Nintendo 64 but all he wants to play is his Game Boy. Eventually the older son comes back with a friend or a girlfriend or someone in a blue pickup truck and the oldest son comes, looks the younger boy in the face. They're sitting at the dining room table. No words are really exchanged but the impression is that the oldest son wants the youngest son to go with him. So at the protest of the mom the younger son grabs his book bag and then leaves out of the front door and in his pickup out on the street and then the end.
