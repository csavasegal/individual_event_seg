So the movie was about a woman who wakes up in a strange room and but then keeps waking up into different iterations. It was reminded me a bit of Groundhog Day or even like a video game where you have multiple lives to advance to the next level. I thought it was interesting the way that it was done. But also a bit strange because with every new thing that she encountered or did that she did the test that was laid out kind of unquestioning. So finding a pin and so popping the balloons, finding an axe so chopping a tree. I was really wondering why she hadn't chosen to chop down a door and just around that time she inadvertently threw the axe, and it went through the wall. But then rather than being hopeful that became like the next test of chopping through walls. I also find it somewhat disappointing that things were suddenly better once the guy showed up -- thing, seemed to kind of an anti-feminist statement of some kind. But certainly having a partner to chop through walls with is better than doing it on your own I guess. And then even though there was some hope with partnership it was when the camera pulled back, and it seemed like there was an infinite number of rooms to get through, that seemed somewhat dystopian and a bizarre thing. But I guess it's supposed to be some sort of statement about how life goes.
