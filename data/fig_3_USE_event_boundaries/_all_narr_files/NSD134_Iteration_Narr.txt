Well, kind of confusing for a woman who’s stuck there in that prison like cell. And couldn't drink that glass of water, I don't know what that was about. It's almost like she had some kind of magnetism. Is that a power? And it looked like a comfortable cell if that's what it was, but she really didn't want to be there. She didn't understand why she was there. And the popping of the balloons was really dramatic, but I guess she assumed there would be a key inside one of the balloons. And then meeting that man and the chopping down of the tree. She's sort of replicating herself and I guess there was shadows on the walls that were being projected but I couldn't help but think that maybe those might have also been people that were imprisoned here. I hope she found peace in the end. It seemed to be intense. She really wanted to kill that tree. I guess there's nothing else for somebody to do if you're bored in a cell. I didn't really connect with that video so much myself. Seemed like a nice person otherwise, like it seemed like she was being oppressed like wrongly imprisoned. It wasn't like she understood why she was there. And it was interesting that she kept waking up. She didn't like the interaction. It started with her waking up. Bbut I hope to never be in prison myself. That's one thing that terrifies me more than anything else. I didn't—yeah, I mean I was worried that she would step on the broken glass and feel some pain. That didn't seem to happen. What I didn't understand what that pressing the button on the floor was about, kind of strange. I guess originally that's how she could talk to her --. I'm not sure if the sound is supposed to be muffled or if I'm just not hearing things as clearly as I should be.
