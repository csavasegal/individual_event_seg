Okay, the penguin timer was actually kind of cool. That was the very first thing it really showed, but the brother in better terms is a bully and kind of a dick. He kept taking all of his sister's food and just straight up bullying her along with other people. She would try to be nice to people, like letting him have a seat on the bus and the brother would notice and he would just be a complete jerk about it all. And could definitely tell she was tired of it all and the one math that she was doing which at her age which I knew she's at least like elementary school age was really, really impressive. And to find out what she was actually doing all this experimenting and just math and everything else, the reading was not expected. I did not know she was going to build a time machine with all that while the brother was just being big, dumb, bully brother. The mom kind of played no part in the whole film besides a mom I guess. Made a lot of pizza and fries which is probably not the best thing to kind of give to your kids, but I think that's besides the point. Also did not know that the tomato thing was a ketchup holder, that also for some reason was weird. I thought that was a like juice container because I really wasn't sure how old the kids were at first. But I had no idea why the brother was the way he is, that's probably just playing the older brother bully stereotype to younger sister. The race scene was kind of mean, definitely should not have distracted her. But I feel like compared to everything else that was kind of the least concerning thing because then definitely something like A, my friends would do to each other. It's still kind of mean but not the worst but you could definitely tell it let her down. So no, that time machine was really cool. Don't know why she decided to make the triangle, but I mean, that's up to the creator. It just definitely was an interesting choice.
