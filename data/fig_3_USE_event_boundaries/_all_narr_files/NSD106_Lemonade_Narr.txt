Speaker 1:	 I thought it was interesting, but I can—I'm assuming this person who put up this domino is an engineer of creativity on the 100th degree. Very, very, very, very, creative. Because after a while I'm just going to like enough already. It was too much over the top. I'm glad he has a family who supports him. I saw the photograph that shows that he obviously lives with others in the house, and they must truly, truly support him to allow him to build all that and probably assist him with that. I'm hoping that he also can pursue a career in mechanical engineering because that seems to be his love. I assume that was a man because I saw his legs in the video. But after a while it's just like enough already. It's you're creative yes, and I guess I was not that impressed after a while. You know it could have been done in half the time and showed your definite creativity. But good for him. He used every aspect of the house from the bedroom's walls, kitchen stuff and then he went outside. Wow. Super, super creative shows his intellect and he used gears and mechanics and streamlines things. But again, like as creative as it was it was like enough already. You showed your creativity. You want to do something. Again, hopefully he got to The Guinness Book of World Records with that for the number of gears or something. I wondered if he is in The Guinness Book of World Records for the craziest waste of time for your intelligence. So that was pretty cool. I'm glad his family is able to support him because that is what matters so, yeah. He's good. He shows a lot of time being spent, a lot of details, very detail oriented. Very detail oriented and a lot of time. A lot of time. Don't do that in my house. Just keep that over there.
