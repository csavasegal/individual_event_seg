Well at this scene I started to feel a little tense the first time there was a countdown and she passed out. Then woke up again and I started thinking about if this was happening to me what I would do? I'd probably be freaking out. And then as she started to go along and so she got through that first door and then in the second room there were the balloons and trying to figure out how to pop all the balloons fast. I started to think what's the purpose of her having to go through these different rooms that she was going to pass? And then I started to—as she started to kind of realize okay, it was a balloon specifically that there was a key in one of them. I started to think okay, it's not necessarily what the test that you have to do to get to the next room. Is it specifically what you I think it has to be the first test? And I think I was also due I was thinking about that more with the in the room where she had to cut down the tree. And then once she got into the room, the one after the tree and she saw the guy I started thinking more about what's the purpose of this movie? And are the -- trying to send a message of especially when they bring a like partnership and working together. I also sort of felt relieved for her because I'm sure that as she was going through each session of doing the same things over again she was starting to feel like the key was set out. And I think when you're doing that alone especially it can kind of—it wears you down even. And that was also shown too in that one scene where the countdown started, and she just like stayed in bed. So, I thought it was nice when it showed towards the end that there was someone else who's kind of going through the same thing that she was going through. It's just reassuring to show that you have someone else there with you going through similar things.
