Speaker 1: What I liked the most was the way the camera kept moving the whole time and would pan around the house and it helped show the passage of time. I also noticed there was a lot of green and yellow in the scene. Don't exactly know what was going on. The kid didn't seem to be very happy in the house. It just seemed kind of sad and the father seemed pretty angry. They didn't seem to have a good family. And even like outside it was even kind of dreary. It was foggy and dark. It looked kind of oldish and rainy. Inside the house didn't seem particularly lived in. It looked like there was no—there was one painting on the wall and then it ended up in the fire is kind of all I remember. There was toys on the floor I remember that. Some birthday he turned five. There was a cat that I wanted to see again, I didn't. Then there was a dog which I also kind of took as the passage of time.  He came on a bike and left in a car. I'm not really sure about that part. I felt like he came in on a bike and then he was taking the kid with him and then he was in a truck with someone else in the truck with him. I'm not exactly sure why he took him. I know the kid seemed very unhappy in the house and that's about it.
