Speaker 1:	So the video opens with a couple, a young couple moving into a house, and you feel their excitement. I got a sense of the hopes, dreams that a young couple in that situation would have and the things that they would feel in starting a family. And having children and you know the day-to-day life kind of sets in and you kind of go along in the grid just like they did. The day to day and the kids grow up and it was an interesting film. That it didn't show, or it showed very little conflict. I guess there was only one argument that was shown on camera but on screen, but it was very subtle but there was still a sense of the rising tension. And I kept thinking of my own family and my own kids. One thing that stood out though was a photograph that was on the wall, and I don't think I got a really clear shot of it, a clear look at it but it looked there were three children. There was never any little girl that was shown in the film, but I thought I saw a little girl in the photograph and kept wondering if she was going to show up in the film. Now I'd like to kind of go back and see that is exactly what I saw, I kept looking for her and she didn't show up. And then kept thinking about what the relationship between the couple was like as their children start to leave. So the oldest moves out and the father does nothing to try and stop him in the moment that he's leaving. Then the oldest comes back for the youngest and they leave together and I wondered why that might have been if there was any sort of abuse occurring. Why would the older brother come back to I guess apparently rescue his younger brother?
