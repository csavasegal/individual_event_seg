First they go we'll call it in the first room, the first iteration and glass of water there fell down and shattered. By the time the iteration was ended she was hitting on the -- pad to figure out how to open the door. After three iterations she figured out how to escape the first room. It was use the previous iteration to hold down the pad that was on the floor to open the door. After she figured that out she went to the second room where a dozen of balloons came down, fell down and there was a key that she had to break all the balloons to get from that room. After taking new iteration trying that she noted the key. She noted the key one, that need the key, so she break to find the key one of the balloon and she did find that in the first one of the balloon that open the door. When she got to the third room where the tree was she saw an axe and tried to cut down the tree. After three iterations she's trying to cut it down the tree and the axe, she noticed that the tree is self-healing, and it won't be --. After that out of frustration she threw the axe through the wall, and she noticed that a wall—that the axe went through the wall. So she break down the wall and go into another room where she met another person escaped from his room. After that iteration they came back to the same room trying to use the axe that they had to break—take down the wall of the other room and take down the walls from the other room and escape from the rooms that they were in. The thing they didn't notice and realize that there were multiple rooms that they needed to break the walls and escape. At first she was scared. She was panicked but at the end she was more frustrated and irritated by the iterations as they went on and she wasn't panicked demonstrating or she wasn't panicked -- at the end.
