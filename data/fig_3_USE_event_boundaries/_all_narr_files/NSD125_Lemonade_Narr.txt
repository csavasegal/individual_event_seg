Speaker 1:	So I love Rube Goldberg machines. I think they're just amazing pieces of what the human mind can do and our mastery of different materials. I think that the—this particular video was just so soothing. It was a mixture of jumps and calm parts. It just flowed very well. The vast use of the—the vast number of materials that were used was absolutely outstanding. I don't think I've ever seen a Rube Goldberg machine that long before, including the inclusion of both inside aspects and outside. And the nice touch of the family picture really sold it for me. I've always wanted to do something like that in my own house, but I've never really had the time or the understanding of how it works. It just makes me think how long that took them to set it up. And how many trial runs they had to do before they got it to work? I really like the person's outfit in the mirror. I thought that was funny. But it didn't seem like such a big space. It also seemed like they were on vacation because I saw a couple suitcases in the corner which was quite interesting. I really want the track of the car track that latch on to the walls. I thought that was really cool and if I had that when I was a child I don't think I would have ever left my home and played outside. The bathroom part of the video was very cool especially when it showed the laptop playing the same thing that the ball was doing. I thought that was really nice as well as the phone call. I wonder how they figured out that the vibration was going to make the phone fall? And whose phone was chosen to make that deadly drop? I just think the sounds are quite soothing especially the really abrupt changes. I thought those were quite exhilarating into the softer moments. Very well done, very tasteful, very soothing and I'm going to want to watch that again.
