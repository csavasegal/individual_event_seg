This video goes looks into the life of a family over the course of a few years I believe. So there's a mom and dad started a family. They moved to an apartment—no to a house where they have two babies -- and one's the older one felt like -- when we left, and he left. He moved out. And then eventually he came back to take his younger brother with him as well. And it's a very nice video of what is happening now in what is happening -- in the American culture where it's like --. The family's moving toward very fast compared to other portions. So they have a baby, it looks like they have a very nice family from my understanding but that nothing was—the younger—the older son moved away. He was mad at his dad for something that I believe he did or say to him. And then after some time he came back, and he kept taking the younger brother with him as well. It's a very nice video. At the beginning where they lived in the house and the house wasn't big enough for them. They expanded it because they hope that their family wanted to grow and would stay together a long time. But evidently it did not happen so for them. But they still have renovated but the nice, interesting part is that even though the mom and dad also had an argument they still stay together. Especially when his children are they're arguing with their parents they moved away. It's a very interesting video. I think relating to not work in a culture like I would say. It kind of brings a—gives a very broad perspective into it. I'm not sure these people—I'm sure this video is very unique in how in one shot where it's like get your whole life over that family to one long shot in the same house. It would just tell a very great story about this family building scenario. I thought it was a great video and I enjoyed it.
