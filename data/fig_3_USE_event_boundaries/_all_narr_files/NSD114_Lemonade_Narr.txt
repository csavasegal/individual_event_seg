Speaker 1:	When life gives you lemons you make lemonade. So this video's basically are just mathematical precision of things falling from, falling to, falling into, falling at, sliding, pulling, plugging, a lot of domino effect and the ziplines, clothing hangers. I'm sure I saw the clothing hanger sliding and then skateboards. Rubber ducky. This guy just uses like a lot of home available things in order to be the most extra person he can. They're entertaining to watch how things connect from one thing to the other. Sometimes it's confusing how some—what like how this ball—what this ball was to do and then it falls into a cup. And then it releases some sort of marbles that roll into—that basically roll into something else and then they create a reaction. It just goes on until the desired effect is reached. And in this one we all the way down to open sort of like one of those coolers for lemonade and that was the end. The purpose was to release lemonade outside so that it could fill in the cups. I think it was pretty creative and fun. It did seem a little long. There were a lot of like railroad—I mean like train tracks. A lot of sort of Jenga or Jenga looking pieces and there were dominoes as well. A lot of wires, a lot of threads, a lot of pulling and then the slime, that slime part of the experiment looked or—yeah, experiment looks like it took a long time because it took a while for the slime to fall into that cup and they showed that by the clock. And that was pretty fun to see. And kind of to get to predicting what it's going to do now, where it's going to go when the ball falls in the cup or the windshield wipers hit the rubber ducky. You just want to—you just keep on guessing. What's it going to trigger? What's going to happen? How is the end goal going to be reached?
