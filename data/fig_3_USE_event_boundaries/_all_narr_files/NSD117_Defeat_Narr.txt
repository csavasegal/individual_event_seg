Speaker 1:	I am so confused on what that machine was and how that machine changed her brother. Anyway, from the beginning at first I just saw a mom cooking. And that just made me miss my mother because I haven't seen her in a while. Then I didn't even—when the little boy took the girl's food I just wondered why. I just kind of saw him as a lost little boy who didn't know left to right. Then I was sad because the little girl didn't stand up for herself and then that made me think about a whole bunch of feminist issues like a lot of the times we don't say things because we feel that we're expected to act—to not act crazy or something, so we just hold back. But then I guess it was kind of funny that at the end she took his food too but also that made me think about how two wrongs don't make a right. My mind was kind of all over the place for this video. I did get a little angry for the part when he purposedly takes the seat of a disabled boy in the bus. I mean I know kids are clueless sometimes on what's right and wrong but that just seems like an extreme. It kind of seemed like he needed a good spanking or something. Then I was also thinking about what the mother was doing. I mean did she just not know what was going on? Maybe she's really busy, maybe she's working. It seems like there was a lot of tension between the two siblings, if they even were siblings. And I didn't really see her too much so just wondered about that.
