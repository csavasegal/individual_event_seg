So when the film started it was interesting because you could see that the mom was a single mom. Right at 6:00 she gave dinner to her children, Tiny and Timmy. It was obvious that Timmy was trying to be mean to Tiny by taking away almost two thirds of her dinner, putting it on his plate. Acting, giving her that expression like you lost to me to his little, younger sister. He would just be so mean. I think he was craving her attention. He wanted to do what she wanted. He wanted her to be like okay, why are you being so mean? Like giving him all her attention especially with that guy on the bus and the race. He distracted her on purpose by showing her, our mom is here and then just running off. You could see that Tiny was getting fed up with it. She was done with it. So when she was done with it I don't know how you can make a time machine and how did she do all those math problems? So I'm like a 10-year-old girl but she seemed really sophisticated and she was so fed up that actually motivated her to do so much which was interesting as well. I did feel really proud that she did that just to show him, don't mess with me because I knew that she wanted to show him what she could do which I thought was great. Throughout the whole film I did feel really proud of Tiny, but I also did feel bad for Timmy because there should be a reason why he was acting that way. I don't know like maybe it's just a coping mechanism for something that happened in the past or that made him act that way toward his sister, just people in general. Because he did seem to be very—also like he would be in his own shadows. He would just keep everything a secret in my opinion. And I felt that the mom could have done a better job of actually caring about her children, but I can't know that throughout this short film.
