Speaker 1:	Okay I have seen this before in an MEG study. So maybe some bias there but yeah, I'm going to try to keep my head still this time. I think that's a good film. It kind of goes through a lot of different emotions. They move in of course focused on their family and then everybody grows up and whatever the kids don't feel as important to the parents anymore, which is sad. A lot of metaphors throughout everything like that picture in the beginning goes in the fire. It's like maybe the family feeling that was once there is gone now so the picture's gone. I think it's interesting how they kept going back to the house across the street. Kind of like the focus is on the house across the street maybe their focus is always elsewhere and not on the kids kind of a theme. I feel bad. I think that happens to some families, but I think, it's hard. Everybody—a lot of things come up and people lose their focus on family. Maybe it's good that the brothers are getting out so they're not living in misery anymore. But I feel bad that the family breaks up. The brother, the older brother kind of abandoned the younger brother in a way which was also sad, but he gets out for himself. Sounds like they still have each other though. And I feel bad it seems like the mom didn't want them to go but couldn't convince them to stay either, so I feel bad for her as well. I think the dad probably felt bad also but of course maybe he doesn't show the emotions in the same way. I feel bad. Hopefully the family comes back together in the future. Maybe they could use that other girl's time machine and go back and fix things. And hopefully that pickup truck doesn’t break down when it's getting up to where they're trying to go.
