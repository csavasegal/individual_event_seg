That was a bit—that was a nice one. What I just watched was a Rube Goldberg machine which is basically one big complex I guess machine where one little simple action sparks a series of other reactions. And ultimately ends up doing something completely unrelated but is still all follows a sequence of chain reactions. So definitely not the first time I've watched this, but every time I watch it it's always something that—always something I enjoy. Yeah, it so it started off with the guy dropped a I think it was a lemonade next to a sign called when life gives you lemonade and then the lemonade fell down a slide and went through all this stuff. And by the end of the video as I kind of assumed would happen was it would be—it would make a glass of lemonade, so that was pretty cool. My favorite part is definitely the phone buzzing thing. I thought that was pretty unique, definitely never seen that before. I also liked the goo part where the at one point they dropped like a little bucket of this slime, or I guess it's Silly Putty. And they put a clock right behind it to show that the entire process of that little part of the machine took like several minutes because the goo took a while to drop out of the bucket. So I thought that was really creative. And, I mean I liked how he pretty much used his entire house for his Rube Goldberg machine. I mean I don't think there was a single room or anything that was left unused. So big props to the creator of that video for really. Definitely something that I don't think I would have the patience to do. I've always wondered what happened if something went wrong or messed up. I would definitely not be able to deal with that annoyance. So it's big props to the creator for making that huge contraption. Overall I would say I liked the video especially unlike the previous two videos that I just watched this is more casual and just something interesting to watch. No storyline just something cool.
