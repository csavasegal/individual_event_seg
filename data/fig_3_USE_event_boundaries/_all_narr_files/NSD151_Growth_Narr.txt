This was a story told in time lapse of a family. It started with a young couple recently fell in love and married, moving into a house together. Showing them through conception, pregnancy, childbirth, the birth of two sons. Childhood birthdays, them growing up together. Then gradually the mood shifts from one of being idyllic and peaceful and full of hope and opportunity to a darker mood. There seemed to be problems with the father's profession at work. There's gradually there developed tension between the married couple and then eventually between the father and the eldest son. Ultimately the father and the eldest son have a falling out and the eldest son leaves. For a while and the youngest son at home with the parents and he feels abandoned, left behind. And then at the end the eldest son returns home having gone out on his own seemingly built a life for himself. Started a new life himself with a partner, returns home and comes to get his younger brother and take him with him away from the parents. The mother feels abandoned herself having lost both of her sons. The father feels confused and powerless possibly wondering how he lost control of his family. I think for me the overarching theme or message was one of generational change, seeing one generation do their best to try to make a life for themselves and then the following generation trying to fix the mistakes that their parents made.
