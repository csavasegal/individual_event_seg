Speaker 1:	Well, interesting that the little girl went to all the trouble to create a time machine because she could more dinner. Kind of an interesting reason to go to all that trouble. I like the plot arc of the film. The bratty little brother is just a bully. It's kind of surprising at the end that she was building a time machine and kind of made her character even more likeable, with the little girl's character more likeable because she didn't do it to create the time machine in order to really do anything harmful to her brother, to go back in time and change anything. It was more of a proactive approach to go forward in time—it goes back in time, so she gets downstairs sooner. And I guess that's sort of the plot doesn't really make a whole lot of sense that the what a bully is just consistently of a brat and cause problems for other people, selfish and mean, unkind, that the bullies take advantage of people.  The oven mitts were interesting. I'd kind of like a pair of those myself. The welder was kind of inappropriate, at least the welder that was shown is not the kind of welder that would make that sort of light that it was originally making. The idea that a little girl would be in her bedroom using a welder at all was kind of humorous. So I didn't like the idea—didn't like the film. Had some rising tension and then a little bit of humor at the end. It was another clever film, very strong characters, and fun.
