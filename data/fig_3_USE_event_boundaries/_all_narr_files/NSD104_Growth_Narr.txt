Speaker 1:	 So the movie starts with a man and a woman, presumably they're married as they celebrate a birthday, and then get pregnant and have a kid. And as they have a kid the kids grow up in the same house so over the course of -- they get older. The first kid, there's like two kids and there are a number of renovations. We see the parents argue at one point. The kids does grow up -- their parents. They're watching TV a lot. They're sitting together. They look like they're maybe closer. It's not really clear whether the parents are still -- at all. They kind of become very mechanical against—around each other. The dad becomes seems more serious. He's on his phone. He doesn't seem to interact with his kids very much. There's a scene where when the boys are teenagers, the older boy seems to have a box of his things and then there seemed to want to talk to his dad --. So he sees then that seems to really impact the younger boy who then feels or who feels abandoned in some way. You see them in the film the actors --. And the older brother—again the house goes through more changes, so it begins to look more and more modern. The whole movie is looking outside the house, so I guess seeing what's going on inside was just this surreal was just really beautiful scenic view of the outside. And the older brother in the end comes home -- show up with a girl. It seems like he hasn't come back, and he greets his mom warmly. So when he goes inside and sees his little brother being silent or withdrawn, he taps his brother on the shoulder and they end up leaving together. The mom is upset about it and tries to keep the little boy from leaving or the younger boy from leaving. But they do and then the two boys get in the car with the girl and they're driving away. So it ends on a note of the family seemingly are broken apart but divided in that way.
