Speaker 1:	The movie made me question whether I understand storytelling. So there's definitely two kids, the mom, two kids what we sort of think of. And then the boy, the older brother takes some before or Tony takes some food before Tiny is able to get --. But from there you can tell that he might pick on her and then throughout the movie he kind of just little things like distracting her or he steals the seat from a disabled kid that she's trying to save. And he distracts her when they're running a race so that she's late. And he seems to kind of just all around put her down and the mom doesn't seem to notice at all. And so Tiny counts down the days. She has something on her mind. She leaves the house late at night sneaking around, being a little suspicious. And then it turns out I guess she's some kind of engineer is building something secretive so well. The brother is in his room doing homework. Kind of jump in time, he goes she's building something, and it would appear that she went back in time either to that first dinner or sort of you know it's obvious that had more food on her plate this time. And then it ends with her outside having beaten her bully at his own game because he's pretty surprised at the end. Got the feeling he wasn't going to mess with her anymore. So why the time machine I'm not sure. Not sure what she did with it. Why that was the approach to anything. There's no dad in the video so that was interesting, it was the dynamic between the mom and the two children. Not inclusive but it was --. Tiny is tiny. She's the small -- so I don't know if she's obviously the same age. I doubt that. She did do very good acting.
