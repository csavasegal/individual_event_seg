I really enjoy those kind of Rube Goldberg machines. It must be like a full-time job to put those together and try them and then film it all in one go. I think that was filmed all in one go. It was just the one part with the curtain that I didn't --. So the part happened really fast, so it was hard to know what exactly had happened. But I think my favorite—one of my favorite parts was with the marbles where he had five marbles and the marbles kept like filling in the holes in the track for the other marble went all four marbles and they filled in the track and the last marble could go over it and continue on. I have to wonder how they come up with those kinds of ideas. Using this really basic household material like a cactus which popped the balloon or like the t-shirt on the line. And then I liked all the race car tracks that he had going. And at one point it even went between the door and the door frame like behind it just which I thought was really funny. And then the person who's filming is very impressed with it. He only caught himself on camera one time during in the mirror but that was not to be prevented I think. I also thought it was really cool that he used all of these objects that can mechanically transmit force or movement. But then also the part where he made a phone call, or I guess the machine, Rube Goldberg machine like created a phone call which then like the other phone started vibrating. I just thought that was really cool to incorporate the non-mechanical things in a kind of that's digital transmitted across the ethernet. So that was super cool. And then of course there would have to be lemonade at the end because that's how it started when life gives you the lemons. Too bad his machine couldn't have made the lemonade. It was already pre-made in one of those container things.
