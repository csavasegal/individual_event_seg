Speaker 1:	 I thought this was about family values and that parenting is not for cowards. It just brings to mind how hard and how important that being good parents that are engaging to their children is necessary for them to become viable citizens. I'm thinking about my own family now and how our daughter pretty much was rebellious and at a time where we were—we'd been talking to each other. We were talking at each other and I'm thankful now that she's coming back into the fold and being part of the family again. But it's also thinking about a close friend whose daughter has been expelled from the school because of parents not—what I think are not listening to her. I was sorry to see that the boy seemed to grow away from the family. For whatever reason the older one feels like he was not part of his family by the way the father kind of was kind of passive. I saw the mother trying to engage the son but if you don't have a strong father figure to teach a boy how to be a man the boy does not become a man. He becomes a man off of images of what he sees on TV, how his friends say a man should be. And if that father kind of just stands back and waits the boys especially need that man to show a man how to be. And I just felt like you didn't really see a lot of the father trying to be engaging with the sons. I also saw some like the house was not really taken care of. Like did they really take care of the sons like taking care of the house? Like they're still sitting on the same little bench they're sitting on when they were kids and now they're teenagers and they still have the same little area like they're babies. Where was the growth in how the house was supposed to be built to show that they are growing as into young men given in their own space? And I didn't see that and I'm trying to figure out why they felt lost.
