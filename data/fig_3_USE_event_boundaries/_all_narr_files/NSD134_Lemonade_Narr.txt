I really enjoyed that. It's an incredible amount of work. My favorite part was the cactus popping the balloon. Also the vibrating cell phones was pretty brilliant. I loved the mouse trap of course the mouse traps using classic dominoes. I thought it was interesting that they had to film the goo so long as it poured out. That would have been really cool, so many variables. The shirt sliding down the on the hanger down the rope and how you just hope that works out well. Also you know the basket rolling, wastepaper basket was pretty cool. And just a lot of activity to set that up I guess a lot of rolling balls is a key one. That spinning twizzling I don't know what you call it but like it looked like a spider almost, very neat. I also thought that you know the race cars were neat down the tracks and the loop de loops. A lot of elevation up and down from all the way up the door frame. It was cool how it took it all the way outside, rising the blinds even on the window was really cool. I kind of just thought it was really neat all around even the magnetic balls, the five balls as each one would fall down it would open up the door for the next one to come down until they filled that gap and then that last one could roll through was really incredible, a lot of innovation to that. So, I thought it was a really cool thing. Toilet paper rolls, that was pretty funny and the toilet seat how it flopped down. Kind of cool how it moved through every room in the house. That was kind of thematic I guess. And then the frying pans in the kitchen opening and closing drawers. The water pitcher in the sink poured into the cup, flipped over, and poured out the lemonade at the end of the event. That was pretty cool. I liked it.
