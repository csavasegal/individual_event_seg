Well this was a good piece. I really liked the way that they went through the different decades. And the cinematography was phenomenal. The way that they just went in and out and went from piece to piece and the transitions were so seamlessly smooth. Once again it's really hard to pinpoint where the setting of this is because it just it looks so foreign. I noticed that some of the—it was kind of funny like some of the technology was in the wrong place like in the wrong decade. But, definitely the family dynamics in this were serious and it really I guess it touches on kind of a cliché about how being overworked and living at your job is detrimental to maintaining a cooperative family. And also how everybody thinks I guess the suburban life is the ideal and then when you zoom in in this way you kind of see that it's more dysfunctional a lot of the times. Definitely the colors at the end, the green, they really kept—was captivating visually. And if they had played different audio in this it would have totally changed the ambience of the film. The way that they used such eerie sounds it really had the potential to trigger emotion in ways that would not have been possible with another soundtrack. Overall it was a good film though. It kind of felt a little PSAish but still fond of it, nonetheless.
