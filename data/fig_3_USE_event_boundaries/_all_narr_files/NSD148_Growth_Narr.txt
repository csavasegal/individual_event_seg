First the couple arrive at a new purchased house with a blue car. They moved in and after they had their first kid and after that they had their second kid. They celebrated the fifth birthday of the oldest kid and after that they decided to renovate the house, make the house bigger. So start the renovation and in the process they seem like they adopted a dog. And while going to remodeling the parents had an argument that impacted the kids' behavior. And after that the oldest son decided to move out after having an argument at dinner table with his dad. Impact his self and move out the next day. And the little brother was seemed unhappy, and it seemed like the move had an impact on the little brother behavior and psychology. After a while the oldest brother came back to visit the parents and the little brother and he brought a gift, and he notice that the little brother burned the picture that was on the wall. And the older brother noticed that the younger brother wasn't doing too well emotionally so he decided to take the little brother with him out of the house while the mom was arguing with the older brother and the dad was just watching them as they left. At the end the older brother and younger brother left the older brother's girlfriend in the blue truck a part of the way while the dad was just watching them leaving in the blue truck. In opinion the dad could have been more engaged, could have shown more emotion to his two children. Mom tried to prevent both kids leaving the house, but she was unsuccessful and buying gifts for the kids you won't motivate them. You won't cheer them up.
