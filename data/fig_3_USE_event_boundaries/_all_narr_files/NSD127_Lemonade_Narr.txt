So I just watched a video of what I would call a really elaborate mouse trap in someone's house. The only person in the video was the guy who was taking the video of the all of the pieces. It took up the entire—it basically took up the person's entire house then went outside. There were all different types of contraptions, and everything was just like perfect, had to be perfectly aligned. There were marbles and there was a sign that said it started off with when life gives you lemons. Marbles, tunnels, hangers, other household items, a fan. The really cool part was I thought was when the phone, one phone made the other phone ring and then the vibration made the phone fall and achieve the chain. Kept the chain reaction going. And then I thought it was also really cool how it transitioned from inside the house to outside the house and how it must have taken many, many tries and a lot of time to figure out how to set everything up so perfectly such that there wouldn't be any error or mix up along the way. I also thought it was pretty cool how it just covered so much space. I think about some of the other items that I remember seeing like the clothing on a hanger and string and dominoes and the lemonade that got poured. And the only time that someone a person was needed to do something to keep things going was when the guy had to physically move the cup of lemonade so that they could continue to keep moving. There was a basketball, a skateboard. There was one picture frame of a group of people maybe the family or the friends that live in the apartment. It was really interesting to watch and very captivating. It was always sort of a feeling, a moment where you weren't quite sure whether it would keep working and it would make it through the entire course.
