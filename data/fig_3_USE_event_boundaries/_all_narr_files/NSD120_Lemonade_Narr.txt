Speaker 1:	So the movie was all about this incredibly intricate mouse trap sort of contraption. It all was set up in this a normal looking house. The whole thing started in a kitchen. The first thing you saw was a letterboard that says when life gives you lemons and the first obstacle to move was a lemon. And the movie just followed this obstacle or different obstacles whether it was a lemon or a little ball or race car track, many different items were used. But it just followed it through the house. We started in the kitchen and then moved to the living room and to the bathroom and then eventually the film ended outside. The film ended with the end of the obstacle course or mouse trap course was a lemonade, I guess it was some sort of drink. A few cups were being filled up with lemonade and that was the end of the film. Throughout the film at one point there was a jar of slime that was turned over and then sort of time the movie sped up and we had to wait until the slime hit the bottom, another cup for the obstacle course to keep moving. At another point there—something with two phones. A phone had to call another phone and while that phone vibrated we're waiting for it to fall to knock something else over. There was a lot of dominoes, and it was just a very intricate obstacle course or maze. There was books involved. There was a shirt on a hanger. At one point we actually—there was a mirror. We actually saw the person who was filming it. There was a bunch of dominoes, and the person filming was just following the ball or the racetrack, so it moved throughout the house. The film was kind of shaky. It made me a little dizzy.
