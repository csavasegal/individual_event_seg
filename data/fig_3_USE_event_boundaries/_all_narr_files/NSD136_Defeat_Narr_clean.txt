Well, this short film is about a little girl and his brother. The little girl called Tiny. So Tiny his brother always going to come to dinner early and take all his—her food so she wasn't happy about that. The brother's always bullying her and stuff all the time. That even when they're going to school they're participating in sports or whatever he's going to bully her. So has some issue with to making a time machine to go back in time and his brother and did the same thing to him and hopefully his brother is going to learn his lessons or do that again. So that was the kind of like the whole story. I think that Tiny was really doing it -- he didn't doing anything to hurt his brother. All he did was kind of give him a taste of his own medicine. Took the food that he took from him, to do the same thing to him. That he wasn't really happy so I'm sure now know it feels to do some the same thing to somebody else. I think his brother wasn't a nice person because as your little sister you should probably not treat her as -- that she probably is or person that she is. The house is so like pretty --. It's wonderful that she has to get away or grow up be by herself. I'm sure --. If it wasn't enough but he decides to just take his sister's food instead of leaving it, being nice. He was just trying to be a bully a bit. And his sister had a nice --. Tiny had a nice -- so that was a very beautiful story or beautiful end to the story. I think that might exist because it was coming that she the sister is so was a nice person but -- to accomplish or psychoanalyze why she know how to do this? Using her knowledge -- the time machine. Plus she used to having her own --. So now I guess she won't be late for dinner again unless she want to use the time machine I guess.
