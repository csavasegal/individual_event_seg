Speaker 1:	This was about a guy who made a Rube Goldberg machine which is a machine that uses a very complicated way of machinery, different type of energy to accomplish a simple task. And he used it to fill a glass of lemonade outside his house. So he used a bunch of household items and a lot of them were balls. He used a lot of different type of energy. He used a phone vibrating to fall off a table. He used a fan switching on. He used a spring in a race car set and he did some interesting stuff, like he moved in on a photo of him and his friends. You could see him in a mirror at one point. He was wearing shorts and it seemed like it was just a home video showing what he and his friends possibly made. The Rube Goldberg machine went all over his house. It started off on like a living room and then at one point it was in his bedroom. I think they threw a bra at the wall at one point or something that looked like it was kind of came apart. And there's a t-shirt that flew across the room which triggered a trip wire, and it was interesting how he used height differences to give something more energy. Because it all starts with the one push and I mean, there's a couple cheats along the way like making the phone vibrate kind of adds more energy into the machine that's from battery power. It looked like he was in some place like kind of sunny maybe or maybe California and it had a sign as he's running on his way to get to the lemonade stand that says lemonade. And it turned on a switch that turned on the lemonade and there wasn't a way to turn it off and there are several cups lined up. As soon as it filled up the first cup he picked it up and that's where the film ends. Yeah, there's a light bulb at one point that I thought was going to shatter but it didn't, it just hit something else.
