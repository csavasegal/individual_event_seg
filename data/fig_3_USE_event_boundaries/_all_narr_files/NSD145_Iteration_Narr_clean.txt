That was a pretty crazy video. If I had to summarize it too I'd say it was a woman who is in a room, wakes up and has 60 seconds to do something in the room. She keeps having to get she falls back asleep or is knocked out. There seems to be some sort of internal force causing that. And she remembers what she did in the last segment or in the last iteration as it's called. And it takes her a couple of iterations to figure out that she can actually do something while in this room. And when she figures that out she goes through these tasks that seem to lead to an exit which is really just another room. And it's really interesting to see her progression from being horrified or very anxious and very confused not knowing what's happening, to feeling she has some sort of purpose or a goal. And then when a task seems really impossible she will try at it pretty hard and then for example with the tree it starts to grow back together, she kind of felt at a loss and gave up in the following cycle before she got back. I don't know some kind of --. I also thought it was really interesting when she would come to a room and there seemed to be a task popping the balloon that there was a pin. So it was clearly showing her to pop the balloons but that she was able to use creativity to figure out a way to kind of bypass that for her to come up with a final solution that got her beyond that phase -- in the keyhole. And then in the end that kind of ending there should be a bunch of the cubbies, you're never really knowing when they end.
