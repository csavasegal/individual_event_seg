Speaker 1:	This movie also seemed to have some sci-fi elements into it although we don't realize it until much later. It starts with the scene with their mother baking something in the oven. And then you see the two, the brother and sister having dinner together. And then I'm not sure if there was a third brother who walked on crutches. It did seem that like the younger brother of the two brothers was definitely selfish. He in one scene he was on the bus and he's going back towards the back of the bus to sit, then he took the seat that would have been for his brother which is pretty messed up since his brother was on crutches. And then the other scenes are just the sister trying to compete against the brother and get in the race. There's the race she had with him. And she gets to be—it's inspiring to see her not give up after that even though he's older than her. And so he's going to be stronger than her, faster than her at a lot of things. Maybe even smarter than her you would think. And then it shows a scene with her working on some mathematical formulas, physics, and whatnot, sneaking out of the house. So then you start to realize wow, she's smarter than she seems. Until she starts working with electricity which is some very advanced work, and she creates a machine. I had a feeling it might be a time machine, but it was definitely my fear was that they prove it after she went inside it. And after that went back to the original message that their mother had for them in the scene when they got dinner. And now that she's gone back in time, and she knows what's already going to happen. She was able to fill her plate up with his food. Interesting way to use a time machine though to beat your brother who you find to be annoying and selfish. So go back in time, you beat him a few times. Then go maybe become more humble, so a very wholesome movie overall because of that.
