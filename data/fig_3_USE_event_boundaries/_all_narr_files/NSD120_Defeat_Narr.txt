Speaker 1:	The movie opened with a woman cooking dinner. She has a penguin timer, and the timer goes off and she opens the oven door and prepares two plates for her two kids. And then she calls down to them, their names are Tommy and Tiny. Tommy is the older brother. Tiny is the younger sister. And she puts the plates on the dinner table and Tommy comes down first and steals the food from Tiny's plate before she comes down. And then we see another example of Tommy he took the seat from a boy with crutches on the bus and then we see many other examples of him taking food, taking Tiny's dinner. And then we also see flashes of Tiny in her room. She has this calendar that after each day she marks off with a red X and then on the 16th there's a red exclamation point. So it seems like she's looking forward to the 16th for some reason. And we also see her reading and studying and doing a lot of math and building something. We don't know what it is yet. And then it also flashes to some sort of race which there are spectators and Tiny, and Tommy are both in the race. Tommy distracts Tiny at the last minute, at the last second and he gets a head start and wins the race. Then eventually the 16th comes and sort of the culmination of Tiny's project is a time machine. And she builds this time machine and Tommy hears the commotion, so he goes to peek into her room and sees that she's building something. And this is at like 5:57, about three minutes before dinner time. So he looks and sees what she's doing and then he hears his mom call for dinner. So he goes downstairs expecting to do the same thing, steal a little of Tiny's dinner but he finds her downstairs, already downstairs with her plate filled with most of his food much to his surprise.
