Speaker 1:	 So it started out kind of weird. At first I thought she had a rough night and couldn't remember where she was. Then it reminded of the movie Happy Death Day where she keeps reliving the same day which is her birthday and the day she dies which was frustrating, kind of funny. Then I started paying attention to the fact that it looked like she was just being experimented on to kind of watch her behavior. Then I started to get really intrigued every single time she would go into a new room because I would try to figure out how she was going to get out there before she did. Kind of liked the challenge. Then I started to get a little frustrated because I couldn't see an end. Like I just thought it would keep going and going and not come to an end. But then she throws that thing onto the wall and that was awfully satisfying and then I was really confused by that guy who showed up. They seemed to have known each other but I guess it had a happy ending but because I didn't know him as a character I wasn't as happy just because I didn't know him. And then I really liked whenever they looked straight on to the camera so they could take down whatever it was that was making them do this. That was interesting. Oh, and my favorite part that kind of made me laugh was when she told him her number which was like 22 and his was like 67 I think. I just found it funny.
