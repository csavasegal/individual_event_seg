Speaker 1:	Okay, that was pretty cool, very Black Mirroresque. Yeah, that would be terrifying and seeing that zoom out I'm like no thanks. But it's kind of cool. You wake up. You got to figure it out. It's like she's helping herself out and there's like a million of her at once is cool. I definitely felt her when she was like no, I'm just going to stay in bed this round when she thought that there was no way out with that tree, that's terrifying. But heart warming when she sees there's another human in there, very nice. And that would make it worth it, like want to get to the end, sort of work together and get out of there. And I have hope that they'll make it out maybe. And if not they'll have some fun while they're in there, at least they have each other. I wasn't sure in that tree room if she needed to be cutting that tree down or if that was like a little decoy thing. So glad she figured out that she could just bust out of that room. She caught that glass of water, that was good. She's learning as she went. Very interesting. She got through it a lot faster than him which is interesting in my opinion. I think that's a good depiction because men might take a little longer to get through that kind of stuff. No, but she was very smart. She got through it quickly. She was on 20 and he was on 62 or something like that. But now that they have double brain power going on it knew they could get through it faster. Yeah, felt bad for her though that seemed terrible but hopefully she figures it all out. Yeah, definitely could see that as an episode of Black Mirror. How she'd get in there? I'm wondering that. It's a punishment or a challenge? Did she sign up for a study and she's like me? But she ended up in something like that. God, that would be terrifying. Please don't do that to me and yeah, she did great. I think she'll get out of there.
