This showed a family that originally started off happy as one does then at their—I'm not particularly sure what exactly but a disagreement between the mother and the father or the husband and the wife led to some dysfunction but separation. Like they grew more apart. This affected the first child more as he was able to see how happy to how sad or despondent the family became. After the first child I suppose couldn't deal with the father and the dynamic in the family anymore. He decided to leave. That then grew to affect the younger child who I suppose missed his brother. The parents tried to buy his affection which doesn't work or didn't work in this case, and he grew to be more and more sad. His brother would visit him on occasion. A recent visit -- he did and after a couple meetings the brother said you should come hang out with me after he realized how sad his younger brother was. During that the mother and the father—the mother mostly. She seemed to disagree with this decision mostly. The father as he was there now throughout the entire short video. He even though didn't like it he didn't react anyway. He more or less let everyone make the decisions other than the first disagreement between him and his wife. Because of that he never had a chance to I believe share his feelings or convince the other party to you know to reconsider their thoughts or their decisions. I guess he was just a bystander within his own family which did not help things for him. I wasn't particularly sure what made the boy sad going back to when he was on the couch with his older brother one night. It may have been his mother. I'm not sure maybe one of them too was cheating on the other and he was aware. Kind of see how the relationship within the family deteriorated. This is more or less a silent film just because that there was no lines. We kind of get the emotion and we got the dynamic just by the smiles, the reactions with one another.
