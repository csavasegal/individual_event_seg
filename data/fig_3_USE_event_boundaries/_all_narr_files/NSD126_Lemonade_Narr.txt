Speaker 1:	So the video looked like one of those new internet fads where they have relay races of just stuff activating other stuff like another board ricocheting or something like that. It was the longest one I've ever seen. This is really impressive. It kind of made me regret not being an engineer undergrad major but --. I think it's really cool that they incorporated the inside and the outside and they managed to somehow make it into -- making a machine or thingy. Also kind of wondering who had time to like make all of that in their spare time or for instance what they do for a living if they do kudos to them. Looks like it took place in a house maybe out in California. Didn't look like a lot of greenery. The grass looks pretty wilted and dry. Since it's also making me look forward to my Christmas vacation in California with my family maybe we'll do this. Also wondering why that person had -- complicated in their phone for that other cell phone that was being activated. Also kind of thirsty with the lemonade. Also with the sun and the fact that it's probably in California and this dude is in shorts -- in here. I thought this was going to be as full as the room as the other -- again and it is actually blazing hot, and this weather was an absolute --. I will be sure to ask ahead of time what room I'm going to be in for --. Also wondering what that sign was on the tree. It went by a little bit too fast for me to read it. Kind of now that I think about it of it it probably says lemonade stand since he was running to a lemonade stand. Yeah, pretty cool video overall. Really interesting. Probably want to do something like that someday just for fun.
