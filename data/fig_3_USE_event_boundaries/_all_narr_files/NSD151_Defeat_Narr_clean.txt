This film is -- about two young siblings, an older brother and a younger sister. They are being raised by it appears to be a single mother who's often preoccupied with work or studying. She makes dinner for them every night at 6:00 PM. The older brother is a bully. He is constantly using—he's constantly leveraging his age and his size, he's taller, to take things from his little sister and also to almost ceaselessly abuse her. The thing that he does every night is he waits for his mother to call them dinner's ready and then comes the stairs and steals food from her plate and puts it onto his. So then he eats a big meal in order to have lots of energy and get stronger and she is left with not enough to eat. His bullying and mistreatment of others is evidence not just of a boy that mistreats his sister but also in the way that he treats a mutual friend of theirs as they're boarding a bus. The younger sister bides her time though. She makes—she forms a plan. She makes a calendar. She studies complex advanced mathematics and physics and builds a time machine so that she can go back in time a few seconds earlier and beat her older brother down the stairs to the dinner table and take food from his plate and put it onto her plate. The underlying theme to me the thing that I connected with most was the idea of consuming resources in order to prosper. And people who have a wealth of resources it seems the older brother he ate well every night, and he used his strength to bully his sister to steal food from her to really deprive her of resources in order to beat her in the race both through physical endurance but also through tricking her. And then ultimately she corrected the injustice, the imbalance by demanding and taking the resources for herself that she needed.
