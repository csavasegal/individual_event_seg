Speaker 1:	So that film was quite powerful actually. The scene where she immediately goes from the balloons to the lock, I thought it was actually a metaphor for how humans trying to find the best way out of a situation. The entire film was actually about human perseverance and how even though we may be stuck in the same situation we always find new ways to get out. We're always stronger together exemplified by her learning from her own mistakes and how to get out of the room, the first room, the bedroom. And the how the tree had giant gashes in it from her past lives, I thought that was quite powerful. However I didn't really understand why the tree was regrowing. Possibly because it shows that even if we try our best things probably won't change and they always go back to the way they were sometimes. That was a good insight into society. The white of the surroundings was quite disorienting actually. It was maybe a little bit hard to focus because I kept looking for changes in the shadows on the white walls. However, the immediate collapse into the arms of the gentleman I thought that was quite an insightful moment on how what humans need each other in order to survive. We're social beings and I don't think that we could do it without each other. And the immediate drive to work together, I thought that was quite powerful. However it's all for naught because they're never going to escape that giant maze of each room because there are even some rooms that they hadn't even concurred yet like the checkerboard one that I saw that was panning out. I can't remember if she was wearing all black but all black in the all-white room was quite symbolic even though I don't really remember what the symbol meant as I was watching the video. I really like these short films. Quite powerful pieces of the human society.
