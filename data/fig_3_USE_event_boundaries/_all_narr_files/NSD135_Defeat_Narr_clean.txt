Wow, that was a moving film. I wonder where these people are from? The ending really took me by surprise. I thought it was going to be about bullying or something of that sort. I'm glad that this film was had a more coherent storyline than the sample film at the beginning. I'm curious as to what the variables of this experiment are. Like I said the ending of that film really took me by surprise. And I'm curious as to what other projects those filmmakers have worked on if they do any feature length films or things of that sort. Nonetheless though I hope that there's like a sequel to that film maybe see where this storyline goes what the lady is able to do with her invention. Kind of reminds me of when I was younger, and I'd always think about inventing things like that except instead of a time machine I was thinking of a teleportation device. I also really like the soundtrack of that movie. The way the piano chords really went with the scenery and the emotions trying to be -- from the film itself. It was very well put together.
