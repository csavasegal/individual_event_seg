That was kind of sad because the family kind of went through this I mean the whole development of the family. It seemed like it started out pretty good and then by the end the two boys were leaving the parents. But it didn't seem like the parents had necessarily done a whole lot to drive the boys away. Maybe if a I was trying to figure out why that they had fallen apart, or I guess why the relationships had crumbled. And it didn't seem like the parents had done that much but maybe they were being neglectful or something. And then in general there were a lot of feelings of maybe abandonment. And I liked how in the cinematography it kind of like one continuous shot almost but that each time the camera panned it became a new scene that was another step along the way. And in general it was all kind of dark. The lighting was pretty dark and then the music was pretty somber. Is it just how the family progressed from kind of this what it's kind of a country style life to wanting to modernize their house. And then getting a television and operating or renovating the house and then I don't know the parents tried to buy the younger brother's affection, by getting him like a Nintendo thing. But there's kind of this strange dynamic between like sometimes the characters were happy with each other and then sometimes they really weren't and that was kind of hard to figure out why that was exactly.
