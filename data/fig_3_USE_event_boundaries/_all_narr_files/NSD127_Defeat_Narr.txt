Speaker 1: So this video was mostly about a brother and a sister who do not seem to get along well at all because the older brother seems to be very cruel even inconsiderate to his younger sister and to others in general. For instance he would get down to dinner before his younger sister and take her food. He would—he took the seat of the boy who walked in crutches. He made his sister miss the sounding bell when they were in a race together. And so most we see the younger sister who is—seems—who is a genius, very, very smart working on this project. At first it's not really clear what the project is. To me it seemed like she was planning to either hurt her brother, kill her brother, burn the house down. But then as we see night after night she's working on this project and one night we see her even leaving and so at that point I thought she was maybe running away. But then we see her furiously working on her iPad with the machine doing complex math and it turns out she was working to develop a time machine in order for her to sort of outwit or outsmart her brother and to make it so that she made it to dinner before him. And to have she would be able to just sort of be one or two steps ahead of him. He seemed pretty confused and scared and uncertain and then it was interesting for me to just watch the relationship between the brother and the sister. The younger sister seemed very kind, very sweet, very smart, strong, very inventive. Their mother really seemed to love them both equally and the brother just didn't seem to care or realize what he was doing to her, his sister and friends and others. Maybe it was just sort of an older brother, younger sister relationship but he seemed to be particularly mean and cruel. And was very surprised at the end to see what his sister had been working on and that she had sort of outsmarted him.
