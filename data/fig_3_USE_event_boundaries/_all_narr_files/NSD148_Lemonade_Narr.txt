The video started in the kitchen with a sign saying when life gives you lemons. After that a lemon rolled down a bar then balls started rolling. It went all the way to the kitchen thing when the faucet turn on. Then the water poured down in the jar on to the it was still all the way up. Then a cup after the jar was the pitcher was filled up with water, the water slowly in the disposal glass, disposal cup. Then it made the ball roll over again it went to another room. The series of events after that happened even also to another room to follow the path and trigger multiple falling balls to the point that it went to the room that made one of the cell phone make the call to another cell phone in the other room. So the other cell phone in the other room to vibrate and drop on the table to continue the ball rolling down the series of event. Then the ball went to the room by the sliding doors, over the sliding doors a soccer ball rolled down. And the skateboard had a piece of—a few pieces of wood and then it went back to a backyard. The cable was going down until it hit a big pitcher with lemonade in it. And it triggered the pitcher I guess faucet to turn on the faucet and pour lemonade into four or five glasses that were there. It was—it took longer than I expected but it was impressive to watch all the series of events that happened from the first shot where lemons give you life until the end where it actually lemonade came out of the pitcher. That was unexpected.
