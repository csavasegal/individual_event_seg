Speaker 1:	In the beginning it's the young couple moving into a new house. So the first two scenes they are—they got pregnant. Have a baby and the -- birthday. The filming was really nicely done how they're moving around and changing scenes -- through time. Then you see the second kid. You see the couple planning to renovate the house. It seems like the renovation of where they're fighting started between the couple but because there's no dialogue we don't know exactly what happened. But it's suggested that it was related to renovating the house which I'm sure the kid's getting older. It looks like as the parent's relationship evolves the kids begin to have problems as well. The older son -- does not have a good relationship with the parent based on how he leaves towards the end, leaving the younger brother there. And then how I understood it was he came back to convince the younger brother to go with him. We don't know where they're going. The only scene -- in the movie is that living room that changes with the renovation and changes over time as the characters get older within it. I'm wondering a little bit about exactly what happened between the parents and the children. It suggests that potentially the fighting between the parents the part about creating a bad environment and then back to the. But I thought it was a really engaging video. I think they did a good job with just using that one scene of the primary plot point and the changing of that scene. The other the part I didn't understand was the house that you could see through the window. I also thought we saw the mom in the window at one point show I don't know if there's something going on with the neighbor that was just hinted at there. But I was wondering a bit about that house. I'm assuming that at the end that the picture the kid burned was of the neighbor's house when that comes back to the -- but there's no hint to that much.
