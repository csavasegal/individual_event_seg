Speaker 1:	It was an interesting film. Seems like a fairly original concept. It reminded of George Lucas' film THX whatever that was but not nearly as scary or anxiety inducing. I liked the idea of trying again and again and having various iterations to problem solve and of remembering the way things started and of course what it might be to actually be in it. The idea of encountering a maze like that is kind of interesting. I would like to see kind of the end game wondering what the point is. I wonder how long they can go before they need to have additional support because the glass of water is not very much to keep you going, to sustain life and that sort of energy level. I don't think enough time was spent with the sort of malaise that the female character really encountered in that just one iteration that was shown where she didn't get out of bed. I think if you've got all that time and you're not making any progress the amount of frustration would increase and I at least would probably not be as active as she was after the first few iterations were maybe. Maybe I would have been more—I don't know. But it is interesting to put myself in the places of the characters. I wonder how I would react to the situation. I think I would wonder who designed it? Who built it and why? What's the point? I suppose it's a metaphor for life.
