Speaker 1:	So this video was a story of a family living in a home over the years. It started out in what seemed to be the 1980s or so when the young couple come into the house, starting their home. The woman gets pregnant has her first son in the home. And then we see a scene years later—a couple of years later the son's fifth birthday party and then eventually we see they have two children. And then we see a point at which the husband and the wife are talking seem to be discussing renovating the home and then the two brothers are just kind of hanging on the couch and hanging out together. And it seems like the renovations never really finished or got completed and it was causing some distress between the husband and the wife. And then we see the kids as older teenagers. Then the older son it seems like the parents—there's a strained relationship between the parents and the two sons. And the older son eventually left the house and went off kind of just leaving. And then at a later point he seemed to have come back for a holiday or something like that and seemed like he was welcomed back but ended up taking the younger brother with him. But we—it wasn't entirely clear sort of the reason that the older brother took the younger brother away from the parents. And it seemed like there was a lot of tension in the family over the years. So even though there were the moments of what seemed to be happy moments, holidays and birthday parties and that sort of thing. And then there was a moment it seemed symbolic that the younger brother took the framed picture off of the mantel on the dark green wall. The older brother noticed that it was missing when he came back and that seemed to have some significance to the younger brother to pull the picture off and put it in the fire. And that seemed to have some sort of impact on the older brother.
