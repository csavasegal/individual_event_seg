Speaker 1:	Good film. One iteration after another. It starts with a glass of water falling, a soft pad to touch. And finally figures it out multiple iterations overlapping with each other. One iteration steps on the pad. The other walks through the door, finds the pin. Pops the balloons. Eventually one balloon left with a key. That key opened the door to a room with a tree, a tree with an axe. Begins to chop the tree but really it's just a red herring because the axe doesn't need to be chopping the tree but to actually cut open into the next room. In that room she finds a counterpart, the man. They look at each other with relief and they embrace one another. As the clock counts down she gets back up. Goes straight after the guy. They look at each other and then they look towards the next wall, and they look at that wall and they begin to chop it as the camera pans out revealing essentially a giant grid or maze of rooms for one iteration after another without end. It reminds me of The Cube. It's interesting to see in place of frustration elation but never really having sleep, never really tiring. Constantly having the same thing over and over again. Obviously everyone's like feels that way sometimes. So the sound editing was really good, a very quiet movie. Really effective to have really the only dialogue between the two characters of like maybe around a minute and a half of that. Really get used to the color selection just in terms of the white walls and then having different elements kind of in the various rooms whether it'd be a bed, or pink balloons or a tree. Also very interesting to see that the ceiling's kind of without end even though the rooms have defined lengths and widths but the height is just black. And so I probably would have tried to climb the tree myself to take a look around. It's interesting to see the environment --.
