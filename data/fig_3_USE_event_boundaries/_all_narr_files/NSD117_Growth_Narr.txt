Speaker 1:	 The video seemed to be like the story of a family of four from beginning to start from when the parents met and started their life together. And move in together, have their first child, then they had a second. They were making advancements in life. It looked like that dad had a career change. From when they first started he used to dress very casual to business professional. It showed struggles of life and it showed the parents arguing, maybe that's why the first older son left. I'm not sure. I was confused on why he looked so upset. Then it showed how the younger sibling was kind of not seen or maybe understood. They were—the dad specifically—well actually the mom also tried to buy his approval which didn't work. He seemed to be lacking something from them. He also seemed to have a really good relationship with his brother. You could specifically tell whenever his brother first left he used to be a lot more energized when the brother was there but then he left. And he just seemed kind of depressed, kind of alone. And whenever the brother comes back it seems like he's coming back to save him from something but I'm just—I'm trying to figure out what was so bad other than the maybe one or two arguments that I saw between the parents. But I don't know what else that there is that could have been going on. But it seems like it was what's best for the older son to do which was to leave so perhaps that's what was best for the younger brother also. The end.
