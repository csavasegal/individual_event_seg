I have actually watched this movie before when I teach the TMS, but it started as a young couple fell in love. And then have the baby and the baby grow and it seems like a very happy family how the whole family and the friends celebrate the boy's birthday. And at some point they had another child, and they watch—they grew. And it seems like a very happy family at the beginning but as boys grew they started to—the mother and father started to fight, and it just turned into from happy family to unhappy family. And that as the boys grew they started to notice so the older brother eventually left the home and that was very sad. And so I felt sorry for the little brother who was left alone with the parents, and he seemed very unhappy. But then the big brother came back home. I thought he came back home for good but actually he came back home to pick up the little brother and they just left, and it was very sad to watch. I know the parents were very sad. And but I was actually worried for the little brother because he looked so young. He looked like he was in middle school, and I was wondering how the older brother—and he didn't even seem like he's an adult, maybe he's in college or the high school. So I was wondering how he was going to take care of the little brother. Yeah, it was a sad movie to watch. And yeah, and I wish none of the kids had to go through and I am just happy that I have a healthy and happy family.
